<h3 id="hemostasis">Hemostasis</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hemostasis is a complex series of regulated events involving blood vessels, platelets, and plasma proteins leading to the formation of a platelet plug.</li>
  <li>Fibrinolysis is the controlled remodeling of a platelet plug.</li>
  <li>Drugs designed to halt or prevent thrombosis can act on any of these points in the pathway.</li>
  <li>Exposed collagen and vWF binds platelets and tissue factor, activating the coagulation cascade via Factor VII, but also activating tPA leading to fibrinolysis.</li>
  <li>Within the coagulation cascade, there are natural inhibitors of coagulation, which can be manipulated pharmacologically: Anti-thrombin III and Protein C (with protein S cofactor).</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="heparin-and-its-derivatives">Heparin and its derivatives</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Unfractionated heparin</strong>: highly sulfated, negatively charged glycosoaminoglycans. Very heterogeneous (thus problematic), large molecular weight, naturally found in secretory granules of mast cells. IV route, short half life, poor bioavailability. Monitoring aPTT necessary! Cheap! Use when you’re about to send someone to the OR!</li>
  <li><strong>Target</strong>: anti-thrombin III. Leads to decreased thrombin, Factor Xa
&lt;div style="text-align:center;" markdown="1"&gt;
<img src="/assets/heparin-schematic.png" alt="" /></li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;/div&gt;
- <strong>Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)</strong>: developed to give more predictable anticoagulation, produced by cleavage of standard heparin. Improved bioavailability. Mechanism of action: anti-factor X activity. Half life 4-6 hours (longer), given in fixed dose based on patient’s weight and no monitoring needed. Thus, advent of outpatient anticoagulation for thrombosis but be careful in obesity and renal dysfunction. Major adverse effect is bleeding. Expensive!
- Heparin has no intrinsic anticoagulant activity, rather, it <strong>potentiates the activity of anti-thrombin III</strong>, inducing a conformational change in anti-thrombin III to make it a faster inhibitor of thrombin. Also, heparin inactivates IXa, <strong>Xa</strong>, and XIa. LMWH primarily acts on Xa. Thus, heparin doesn’t work well if you have a ATIII deficiency…
- Remember, <strong>thrombin</strong> is a critical molecule: potent vasoconstrictor, cleaves fibrinogen, activates XI, V, and VIII, activates FSF, activates platelets. Thrombin binds to thrombomodulin, which activates protein C
- Notes: both heparin types have some renal excretion, do not cross placenta. Side effects include bleeding, hypersensitivity, HIT (thrombocytopenia with paradoxical thrombosis)
- <strong>Overdose</strong>: Effect can be rapidly reversed by <strong>protamine</strong>
- <strong>Fondaparinux</strong>: synthetic pentasaccharide, thought to form the high-affinity binding site for anti-thrombin III. Has anti-Xa activity like LMWH, but does not inactivate thrombin. Predictable action, used as once daily subcutaneous injection. Lower incidence of HIT, use if they’ve had HIT in the past, but is metabolized in the kidney so use with care in patients with compromised renal status.
- <strong>Use of heparin-like drugs</strong>: #1 Treatment of acute thrombosis (DVT, PE, ACS, stroke). #2 - Prevention of thrombosis (peri-operatively, in immobilized patients, maintain artery patency after thrombolytics). #3 Pregnant women who need anticoagulation.
- <strong>Dosing</strong>: depends on whether therapeutic or prophylactic, depends on unfractionated vs. LMWH, but either way is still <strong>weight based</strong>.
- If someone develops allergic reaction to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), use <strong>argatroban</strong>, lepirudin, or fondaparinux.
- Goals of therapy: Increase PTT, normal 25-35s, heparinized PTT should be two times normal (50-60s). </p>

<h3 id="coumadin--warfarin">Coumadin / Warfarin</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Target</strong>: Interferes with normal synthesis and gamma-carboxylation of vitamin-K dependent clotting Factors II, VII, IX, and X. </li>
  <li>Pharmacology: Takes 4-5 days to get into the therapeutic window, because you have to deplete the Factors that are already circulating; not that smart to use in acute setting! Drug has a long half life (40 hours), and is metabolized by CYP2C9. QD dosing once INR target reached.</li>
  <li><strong>10-fold inter-individual variation in dose</strong>: requires close monitoring of <strong>PT/INR</strong>. Goal INR between 2-3, but this is actually a <strong>very narrow</strong> pharmacological window, and generally requires the work of a full time clinic support. Other pharmacological facts: </li>
  <li><strong>Overdose</strong>: IV vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP).</li>
  <li><strong>Drug-Drug Interactions</strong>: multiple, pay close attention!!</li>
  <li><strong>Teratogenic</strong>: crosses the placenta, contraindicated in pregnancy (like with a mechanical heart valve)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dabigatran--pradaxa">Dabigatran / Pradaxa</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Target:</strong> Thrombin</li>
  <li>First oral anticoagulant approved in 50 years, use in non-valvular atrial fibrillation</li>
  <li>Mechanism of Action: Reversible direct thrombin inhibitor; both free and clot-bound thrombin.</li>
  <li>Pharmacology: Rapid onset (2h), after that twice daily fixed oral dosing, ingested intact. 80% renal metabolism.</li>
  <li>Side effects: higher risk of bleeding compared with coumadin in age &gt; 75</li>
  <li>Other advantages: no monitoring necessary, no drug-drug or drug-food interactions.</li>
  <li>Other disadvantages: cost, can’t monitor adherence, no antidote.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="rivaroxaban">Rivaroxaban</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Target</strong>: Xa</li>
  <li>Approved in 2011 for post-surgical DVT prophylaxis, thromboembolic disease, and non-valvular atrial fibrillation.</li>
  <li>Pharmacology: BID oral dosing, rapid onset, no monitoring. CYP3A4.</li>
  <li>Disadvantages: no antidote, no way to measure compliance.</li>
  <li>Similar Factor Xa inhibitor: <strong>apixiban</strong></li>
</ul>
