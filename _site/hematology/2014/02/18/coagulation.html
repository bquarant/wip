<ul>
<li>&#8220;Must regulate exactly where, exactly when, exactly what size!&#8221;</li>

<li>Critical summary: hemostasis is the cessation of blood flow from a site of injury, involves blood platelets to plug the leak, vWF to bind platelets to the site of injury, vasoconstriction to slow the flow of blood to the injured area, and the formation of a blood clot to stop the loss of blood.</li>

<li>Summarized from the diagram: First, there is blood vessel injury exposing an area of collagen, which allows vWF to bind. Platelets then bind vWF and adhere to the damaged area. Platelets then release serotonin, thromboxane A2, chemokines, and ADP, the next effect of all these factors is vasoconstriction and aggregation of platelets at the damaged area. Both vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation lead to plug formation; activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic clotting pathways leads to blood clot formation. Clot lysis and blood vessel remodeling occur later!</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='key_features_of_blood_coagulation'>Key features of blood coagulation</h3>

<ul>
<li>Blood clot formation is triggered by sequential steps in which <strong>proteolytic enzymes</strong> are activated by proteolytic enzymes activated from the previous steps. These enzymes are serine proteases, homologous to the chymotrypsin family.</li>

<li>Three non-enzymatic factors are also required: Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Vitamin K, and plasma membrane phospholipids</li>

<li>Blood coagulation is an <strong>enzyme cascade</strong>, the activated form of a clotting factor formed in one step catalyzes the activation of clotting factor in the next step.</li>

<li>This leads to a large amplification of the original signal, which might be quite small.</li>

<li>Automatic self-regulation, activation is autocatalytic. Three critical inhibitory mechanisms limit clot growth.</li>

<li>Most clotting factors are made in the liver, their levels decrease in the setting of liver disease. Advanced liver disease is evidence by low prothrombin.</li>

<h3 id='clot_formation_step__basic_rhetorical_questions'>Clot Formation Step - Basic Rhetorical Questions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Now that we&#8217;ve seen the overview of coagulation, let&#8217;s work backwards to understand the mechanisms.</li>

<li>What is a blood clot? It is an insoluble, mesh of fibrous network of cross-linked <strong>fibrin</strong> molecules</li>

<li>What is fibrin made from? <strong>Fibrinogen</strong>, a large common soluble plasma glycoprotein.</li>

<li>What triggers the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin? <strong>Thrombin</strong>. First, a &#8220;soft clot&#8221; forms, which has non-covalent interactions between the fibrin monomers, then a hard clot forms by intermolecular cross-links.</li>

<li>What does thrombin do to fibrinogen? It catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of 4 peptide bonds in fibrinogen. But what is fibrinogen?</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='fibrinogen'>Fibrinogen</h3>

<ul>
<li>Primary structure: two symmetrical halves, formed by pairs of three kinds of homologous chains. A and B are the fibrinopeptides that are relased from the N-terminal ends after cleavage by thrombin. Thus, fibrin has a molecular structure of (alpha)<sub>2</sub>(beta)<sub>2</sub>(gamma)<sub>2</sub></li>

<li>Disulfide bonds cross-link all the chains together, holding the two halves of the fibrin molecules together.</li>

<li>Fibrinogen and fibrin also have two pairs of large oligosaccharides</li>

<li>Secondary and Tertiary structure: rod-like fibrous protein with 5 globular domains, two on each end, one in the enter. Constant secondary structure in the rod parts: supercoiled triple helix of the homologous alpha, beta, and gamma chains.</li>

<li>Thrombin cleaves 4 Arg-Gly bonds to release the fibrinopeptides A and B from the central globular domain, automatically triggering the aggregation of fibrin molecules to form a soft clot by means of removal of charge repulsions!</li>

<li>Fibrinopeptides have a large negative charge; charge repulsion prevents aggregation prior to removal.</li>

<li>Complementarity, i.e. non-covalent interactions, occur between groups on the C-terminal globular domains and become accessible upon release of the A and B fibrinopeptides</li>

<li>Simple summary: when the <strong>negatively charged</strong> residues are released from fibrinogen, fibrin molecules can bind to each other and by non-covalent forces form the soft clot.</li>

<li>Next, <strong>Fibrin-stabilizing factor (FSF, Factor XIII)</strong> after being activated by thrombin, catalyzes the formation of unique covalent bonds cross-linking adjacent gamma chains on the fibrin molecule. FSF requires <strong>Ca<sup>2+</sup></strong> for activation by thrombin. FSF deficiency is an inherited bleeding disorder!</li>

<h3 id='thrombin'>Thrombin</h3>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;The key step and central player in clot formation&#8221;</li>

<li>Thrombin is a serine protease, which like trypsin cleaves after Arg; but given its limited-access active site, only cleaves at <strong>Arg-Gly</strong> peptide bonds.</li>

<li>Thrombin is synthesized as a large precursor, <strong>prothrombin</strong> (Factor II)</li>

<li>Inactive prothrombin is converted to active thrombin by <strong>Factor X (Stuart)</strong>, the common product of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Factor X activates prothrombin by two proteolytic cleavages, and activation requires <strong>Ca<sup>2+</sup></strong> as well!</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='the_linked_roles_of_vitamin_k_and_ca_in_blood_coagulation'>The linked roles of Vitamin K and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in blood coagulation</h3>

<ul>
<li>The N-terminal propeptide of prothrombin contains 3 domains, one of which contains an unusual amino acid which is very negative - gamma-carboxy glutamate (Gla). The domain chelates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> required for prothrombin (and Factor VII, IX, X, FSF, and Protein C) activation.</li>

<li>Vitamin K is a coenzyme for the post-translational conversion of glutamate to gamma-carboxy glutamate (Gla)</li>

<li>Gla domain of prothrombin has <em>several</em> (n=10?) Gla side chains, in order to chelate more Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</li>

<li>Factor X needs <strong>Ca<sup>2+</sup>, proaccelerin (Factor Va), and phosphatidyl serine</strong> in membranes in order to activate prothrombin. Of note, the phosphatidyl serine required are negatively charged and part of the cytoplasmic sheet of the membrane, thus are exposed only in the setting of injury.</li>

<li>Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds prothrombin and factor X to the phospholipid in membranes via Gla domains, precisely at the specific site where the blood vessels were injured.</li>

<li><strong>Important clinical note</strong>: Vitamin K antagonists (competitive inhibitors) like coumadin inhibit bloot clotting by inhibiting new formation of Gla domains on newly synthesized clotting factor proteins. Thus, they have no effect on pre-existing clotting factors, and take days to work (remember average life span is 7-10 days). Heparin and aspirin, conversely, work immediately.</li>

<li>Interestingly, genetic variability regarding processing of vitamin K exists, and explains varying responses to coumadin therapies, especially in Asians. Enzyme - VKORC2</li>

<li><strong>FFT</strong> - A key component of clotting at the right place (<strong>where?</strong>) is the binding of bridging Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions between Gla residues on clotting factors and phosphatidyl serine residues on exposed surfaces of activated platelets at injury sites!</li>

<li>&#8220;Calcium gets two bonds from the Gla domains, and two bonds from PS!&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='the_role_of_ca_in_blood_clotting'>The role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in blood clotting</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ca<sup>2+</sup> is essential for blood clotting!</li>

<li>Ca<sup>2+</sup> is required to form the keel anchor of the Gla domain, which tightly <strong>anchors</strong> the clotting factor to the membrane.</li>

<li>Ca<sup>2+</sup> also forms essential bridges between Gla residues within the Gla domains and phosphatidyl serines which are only exposed at the surfaces of activated platelets at the injury site.</li>

<li>Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays a major role in determining where a clot forms.</li>

<li>Clotting factors are embedded a little below the surfaces of platelets.</li>

<li>Clotting factors are bound within specific clotting factor-protease-co-factor-substrate complexes, which lead to large enhancements of the rates of target substrate formation.</li>

<li>A overview of the three major complexes: <strong>extrinsic</strong>: VIIa-X, cofactor TFIII; <strong>intrinsic</strong> IXa-X, cofactor VIIIa; <strong>prothrombinase</strong>: Xa-II, cofactor Va. <strong>All</strong> require Gla/PS/Ca<sup>2+</sup></li>

<li>What does using the complex do? Increases efficiency drastically (300k x)</li>

<li>Platelet activation allows <strong>scramblase</strong> to translocate anionic phosphatidyl serine to the membrane surface, thus allowing for complexes to form!</li>

<h3 id='intrinsic__extrinsic_pathways__the_big_picture'>Intrinsic / Extrinsic Pathways - The Big Picture</h3>

<ul>
<li>What activates thrombin? Factor Xa, with Va, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and phosphatidyl serine.</li>

<li>Where does Factor X fit in the coagulation cascade? It is at the <strong>convergence</strong> of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.</li>

<li>Historically, &#8220;intrinsic&#8221; pertained to the ability of blood plasma alone outside the body has the ability to form a clot in vitro. &#8220;Extrinsic&#8221; pathway required a factor that is outside the blood plasma (thromboplastin, or Factor III).</li>

<li>What activates Factor X? Intrinsic pathway: <strong>Factor IX</strong> with VIIIa required. Extrinsic pathway: <strong>Factor VII</strong> with IIIa required.</li>

<li>Both pathways are required in vivo for proper physiologic clotting, and complement each other, even though the extrinsic pathway is much faster than the intrinsic pathway.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='focus_the_intrinsic_pathway'>Focus: The Intrinsic Pathway</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Factor VIII</strong> - a non-enzymatic, protein activator of the intrinsic pathway.</li>

<li>How does the intrinsic pathway achieve automatic self-regulation? Positive feedback activation. Factors Va and VIIIa have low activity before they are further activated by thrombin. Blood clotting is autocatalytic, because the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin is accelerated and amplified by the feedback activation of factors V and VIII by thrombin!</li>

<li>Thusly, larger injury, more thrombin, thus more Va and VIIIa. Factors V and VIII have homologous thrombin-binding domains, but non-homologous substrate binding domains.</li>

<li><strong>How is Factor IX activated?</strong> One way is proteolytic cleavage by Factor XI, but that&#8217;s the minor pathway. The major pathway is actually by Factor VIIa with TFIII!</li>

<li><strong>Factor XI</strong> - Factor XIa plays a significant role in normal clotting, but a smaller role than IX or VIII. Deficiency of XI does not lead to spontaneous bleeding, but will have mild to moderate bleeding with injury or surgery. Thrombin can activate XI to XIa.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='diseases_of_the_intrinsic_pathway'>Diseases of the intrinsic pathway</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hemophilia A</strong>: Deficiency in the amount or activity of Factor VIIIa. Large blood loss or hemorrhage from even a small injury or even normal activities like jumping or chewing. There are a <strong>variety</strong> of mutations leading to this state, but it has an <strong>X-linked</strong> inheritance pattern with a high incidence, 1:10,000 male births. Now treated with recombinant Factor VIII.</li>

<li><strong>Hemophilia B</strong>: Deficiency in the amount or activity of Factor IX. Also X-linked, but with low incidence.</li>

<li><strong>Von Willebrand&#8217;s Disease</strong>: vWF functions to stabilize Factor VIII and bind platelets to a damaged area. Von Willebrand&#8217;s Disease presents with decrease in Factor VIII due to decreased stability. Most <strong>common</strong> inherited bleeding disorder (1:800), usually with an <strong>autosomal dominant</strong> inheritance pattern. Type 1: Most common subtype, mild to moderate decrease in vWF. Type 2: lower incidence, low activity vWF. Type 3: <strong>rare</strong>, presents with mucosal bleeding.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='focus_the_extrinsic_pathway'>Focus: The Extrinsic Pathway</h3>

<ul>
<li>What activates factor X in the extrinsic pathway? <strong>Factor VIIa</strong> in conjunction with <strong>TFIII (thromboplastin)</strong>, a membrane protein exposed at the site of injury.</li>

<li>TFIII increases factor VII activity 16,000 fold, and has Gla-domain and requires calcium, just like prothrombin activation.</li>

<li>The more you turn on TFIII, the more you turn on <strong>both</strong> the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways! Determines <strong>when</strong> clotting happens, and <strong>how much</strong> clotting will occur!</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='physiologic_inhibitors_of_blood_coagulation'>Physiologic inhibitors of blood coagulation</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Protein C</strong>: Proteolytic enzyme, activated by thrombin! Requires protein S as co-activator. <strong>Function</strong>: destroy factors Va, VIIIa. Protein C deficiency is fatal. Recombinant Protein C used to prevent clots in sepsis.</li>

<li><strong>Antithrombin III</strong>: homologous alpha(1)-antitrypsin. Potent inhibitor of thrombin and all clotting factors but VIIa, mechanism is to bind and block active site. Balance of thrombin and antithrombin III gives rapid clotting limited just to injury site! <strong>Heparin</strong> works by activating antithrombin III.</li>

<li><strong>Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI)</strong>: Potent inhibitor of the extrinsic pathway, binding to the Xa/VIIa/TFIII complex. Accounts for why extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are about equal in vivo.</li>

</div><span><br /></span>
<h3 id='fibrinolysis__lysis_of_the_clot'>Fibrinolysis - Lysis of the clot</h3>

<ul>
<li>What dissolves a clot? Proteolytic cleavage of fibrin by <strong>plasmin</strong>, a serine protease</li>

<li>Where does plasmin come from? <strong>Plasminogen</strong>.</li>

<li>How is plasmin activated? Proteolytic cleavage by <strong>tPA - tissue plasminogen activator</strong></li>

<li>Where and how does tPA work? It is found in vascular tissues, and binds to fibrin clots where it rapidly activates, cleaves plasminogen. tPA also preferentially activates plasminogen bound to clots.</li>

<li>What regulates plasmin activity? <strong>Alpha-2 antiplasmin</strong> irreversibly binds plasmin and prevents plasmin binding to fibrin. Alpha-2 antiplasmin deficiency leads to a serious bleeding disorder.</li>

<li>Role of tPA in emergency management of ischemia: aggressive treatment of blood clot aspect of heart attacks leads to 95% survival, if patients reach hospital alive. Treatment is tPA in combination with heparin. In stroke, survival and consequences are both markedly improved by aggressive treatment with tPA, but problem is finding time of onset of ischemia. tPA administered after 3h from onset of ischemic stroke has the danger of inducing a hemorrhagic stroke.</li>

<li>Drugs related to tPA: <em>Urokinase</em>, like tPA but tPA is better because it binds to and works on the clot itself. <em>Streptokinase</em>: binds to plasminogen, activates autocatalytic proteolysis of other plasminogen molecules. Side effects include allergy and hemorrhagic stroke though.</li>

<li>Hemorrhage and stroke are potential side effects of tPA, heparin, and all anticoagulants!</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='acquired_hemorrhagic_disorders'>Acquired Hemorrhagic Disorders</h3>

<ul>
<li>Disseminated Intravascular coagulation (DIC). Coagulation reactions are at first accelerated, then followed by fibrinolysis, then cycles&#8230;leading to depletion of cofactors and hemorrhage.</li>

<li>Liver disease. Need a healthy liver to synthesize coagulation factors like protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III.</li>

<li>Vitamin K Deficiency or complications from coumadin&#8230;</li>

<li>Major accidents / surgery</li>

<li>Lupus - make auto-antibodies to factor VIII</li>

<li>Chemotherapy - bone marrow suppression</li>

<li>AIDS - can be hemorrhage or thrombotic</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='factor_v_leiden_mutation'>Factor V Leiden Mutation</h3>

<ul>
<li>Leiden mutation: Arg 506 to Gln 506, abolishes the protein C cleavage site on Factor V.</li>

<li>Consequence: Increases likelihood of thrombosis!</li>

<li>May account for 25% of patients with recurrent DVT or PE.</li>

<li>3% of all people are heterozygotes with a 7x risk of venous thromboembolism. Risk increases with age, pregnancy, and oral contraceptives.</li>
