<ul>
<li>The spleen sits in left upper quadrant, bordered by ribs, stomach, splenic flexure of the colon, and kidney. It&#8217;s normally &#8220;fist-sized,&#8221; mass of approximately 150 grams, 12x7x3 cm.</li>

<li>It is encased by thin gray connective tissue capsule, and contains red pulp and white pulp (visible as gray specks in a red friable/bloody parenchyma)</li>

<li><strong>White pulp</strong>: lymphoid tissue surround medium-sized splenic arteries. The <strong>T-cell</strong> is the main lymphoid cell in the peri-arteriole lymphoid sheath (PALS). There are occasional expansion of B-lymphocytes forming nodules, and when there is antigenic stimulation, germinal centers will form.</li>

<li><strong>Red pulp</strong>: thin-walled vascular sinusoids which are separated by <strong>splenic cords of Billroth</strong>. The endothelial lining of the sinusoid is open or discontinuous, providing passage of blood cells between the sinusoids and cords. Cords are a labyrinth of macrophages, creating a physical and functional filter for blood.</li>

<li><strong>Blood filtration</strong>: &#8220;closed circulation&#8221; - artery to capillary to splenic veins; this is rapid and not filtrative. &#8220;Open circulation&#8221; - arteries to capillaries to splenic cords to sinusoids, to splenic veins. This is a slower process and only a small fraction of blood takes this route, but over the course of the day the entire blood volume is processed in this way. &#8220;Red cells have to navigate through the tiny slits,&#8221; thus requires erythrocyte to be a deformable, biconcave disc.</li>

<li><strong>Function</strong>: spleen is the largest unit of the mononuclear phagocytic system, and is involved in all systemic inflammations, generalized hemopoietic disorders, and metabolic disturbances. Four major functions: (1) filtering and removal of unwanted or old peripheral blood elements by splenic phagocytosis, (2) immune response to blood-borne antigens, by means of phagocytic cells in red pulp and lymphoid cells in the white pulp, (3) source of hemopoiesis, and (4) sequestration of blood elements.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='spleen_pathology'>Spleen Pathology</h3>

<ul>
<li>Most disorders of the spleen involved splenomegaly, which may cause mass effect leading to enlarged abdomen, early satiety, pain, or cytopenias.</li>

<li><strong>Hereditary spherocytosis</strong>: RBCs are spherical due to membrane protein dysfunction, cannot deform to get through sinus cords, leading to phagocytic destruction of the RBCs, leading to hemolytic anemia.</li>

<li><strong>Accessory spleen</strong>: common, small spherical structures that are histologically and functionally identical to the spleen. In certain disorders where removing the spleen is necessary, overlooking an accessory spleen can negate the benefit the removing of the spleen.</li>

<li><strong>Immunology / Histology</strong>: Dendritic cells in the PALS trap antigens and present them to T-cells resulting in an activated immune responses. Enlargement of the spleen occurs in any blood-borne infection. If you find granulomas of the spleen, get an acid-fast to rule out mycobacteria. Hydatidosis is parasitic, not common in US. Splenomegaly after EBV mononucleosis, beware for splenic rupture in these patients.</li>

<li><strong>Splenic Rupture</strong>: splenic rupture is usually precipitated by a crushing injury or severe blow. Less often, they occur from some predisposing condition that renders the spleen fragile, e.g. mononucleosis. Splenic rupture is typically associated with extensive hemorrhage and usually requires splenectomy.</li>

<li><strong>Primary myelofibrosis</strong>: marrow is fibrotic and no longer a source of hematopoesis. Liver and spleen become sources of extra-medullary hematopoeisis, which then triggers massive splenomegaly. Histology of splenic parenchyma looks like marrow histology, with megakaryocytes visible and other developing cell lines.</li>

<li><strong>Sequestration of formed blood elements</strong>: normal spleen contains 30-40ml of blood and 30-40% of the platelet mass. Enlarged spleens contain much more blood and therefore can cause cytopenias. Example: <strong>thrombocytopenia</strong> in the setting of congestive splenomegaly due to portal hypertension..</li>

<li><strong>Hypersplenism</strong> - Triad of splenomegaly, cytopenias, <strong>follow up Slide 25</strong></li>

<li><strong>Hyposplenism</strong> - potentially lethal syndrome due to risk of sepsis, characterized by diminished splenic function. Peripheral blood smears appears as if they are asplenic (Howell-Jolly bodies present &#8220;nucleated remnants&#8221;). Interestingly, hyposplenism can occur in the presence of abnormal sized or enlarged spleen. Sickle cell anemia is the most common disease associated with hyposplenism due to auto-infarction.</li>

<li><strong>Splenic infarcts</strong> -<strong>follow up, slide 27</strong>. Wedge-shaped classic!</li>

<li><strong>Splenic neoplasms</strong>: neoplasms involving the spleen are rare, except those involving the lymphohematopoietic system. Cause splenomegaly.</li>

<li><strong>Differential diagnosis of splenomegaly</strong>: infection (mononucleosis), congestion associated with portal hypertension, lympho-hematogenous disorder (lymphoma) immunologic-inflammatory disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, SLE), storage disease (Gaucher&#8217;s), miscellaneous (amyloidosis)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='thymus__the_basics'>Thymus - The Basics</h3>

<ul>
<li>Important for development of the T-cell and cell-mediated immunity.</li>

<li>Cortex is dark area, medulla is lighter stained. Hassal&#8217;s corpuscles formed in the medulla from from stroma pearlulation.</li>

<li>Normal thymus cortex stains darkly with Tdt (<strong>terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase</strong>), a marker of immaturity.</li>

<li><strong>Developmental disorder</strong>: thymic hypoplasia or aplasia, as seen in DiGeorge syndrome, along with parathyroid developmental delays.</li>

<li><strong>Thymic follicular hyperplasia</strong>: when lymphoid follicles (B-cell structures) are present in the thymus. Normal thymuses only have rare B cells. Thymic follicular hyperplasia can occur in chronic inflammatory conditions or immunological diseases, most common in <em>myasthenia gravis</em></li>

<li><strong>Thymoma</strong> - tumor of the thymic <strong>epithelial</strong> cells. Most arise in the superior anterior mediastinum, benign tumors are usually encapsulated. Consist of proliferating epithelial cells in a background of thymic lymphocytes. <strong>Follow up slide 41</strong></li>
