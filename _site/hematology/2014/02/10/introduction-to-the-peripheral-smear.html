<ul>
  <li><strong>follow up!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="the-complete-blood-count">The Complete Blood Count</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Automated cell counter that measures the following parameters: White blood cell count (WBC), Red blood cell count (RBC), platelet count (PLT), hemaglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), and RBC indices (MCV, MCHC, MCH, RDW).</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="wbc-differential">WBC Differential</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What types of white blood cells are present in the peripheral smear?</li>
  <li>Results may be reported in percents and/or <strong>absolute cell counts</strong>. Why? You can have 80% lymphocytes, 15% neutrophils, but if your WBC is too low or too high, you could be either neutropenic or in lymphocytosis.</li>
  <li>Automated methods have been developed, combines blood smear preparation and staining. Advantages include minimal exposure to biohazardous material, increased consistency, increased optimal counting area.</li>
  <li>Manual method uses a “wedge” approach. Why review a peripheral smear? Primarily to review abnormalities identified by the CBC analyzer (e.g. confirm numerical numerical findings, schistocytes)</li>
  <li>CBC analyzers cannot pick up RBC shape changes, but often the indices point to an abnormality.</li>
  <li>Peripheral smears will be reviewed if: <strong>follow up slide 19</strong></li>
</ul>

### Red Blood Cells
- RBCs: size (microcytic, macrocytic, anisocytosis), color (hypochromic, normochromic), variation of shape (poikilocytosis, e.g. sickle cell anemia, hemoglobin C crystals). Nucleated RBCs, Howell-Jolly Bodies, intracellular pathogens (e.g. malaria)
- How to judge RBC size: make sure you’re in the right area of the peripheral smear, then use the nucleus of a normal, small lymphocyte for a guiding reference.  The variation in cell size is measured by the RDW: small RDW, little variation; large RDW, large variation.
- <strong>Reticulocytes</strong>: RBC newly released from the bone marrow has cytoplasm with a bluish-tinged cytoplasm due to residual RNA. Called a polychromatic RBC on Wright’s stain, to confirm they are reticulocytes use supravital staining. For anemic patients, a low number of reticulocytes implies that there is inadequate production (this is a bad sign!).  </p>

### Neutrophilic Findings of Notes
- <strong>Follow up: slide 41</strong></p>

<p><span><br /></span>
### Leukemoid Reaction
- Persistent moderate to extreme reactive lymphocytosis, usually due to neutrophils. Usually seen in sepsis or other critical illness.</p>

<p><span><br /></span>
### Leukoerythroblastic reaction
- Bone marrow response where nucleated red blood cells and immature leukocytes are released in the peripheral blood
- Usually due to a space-occupying lesion in the bone marrow, such as bone marrow fibrosis, marrow involvement of metastatic tumor.</p>

<p><span><br /></span>
### Myelophthisis,
- <strong>Follow up slide 48</strong></p>

<p><span><br /></span>
### Eosinophilic Disorder</p>

<p><span><br /></span>
### Basophilic Disorder
- Consider myeloproliferative neoplasm!</p>

<p><span><br /></span>
### Monocytes
- Monocytosis: an absolute increase in monocytes. Consider infections, reactive processes, myeloid neoplasms</p>

<p><span><br /></span>
### Lymphocytosis
- Reactive lymphocytosis and atypical lymphocytosis
- Consider: unknown viral infection, infectious mononucleosis, <em>B. pertussis</em>. Atypical lymphocytes in hematology means benign, reactive lymphocytes!
- <strong>Blasts</strong> - primitive cells. May be of lymphoid, myeloid, or unclassified origin. May be acute leukemia… <strong>follow up slide 59</strong></p>

<p><span><br /></span>
### Platelet Reasons to Review a Peripheral Smear
- Spurious thrombocytopenia can occur due to EDTA-induced platelet clumping.
- Platelets can be small, normal, large, or giant.
- Platelet satellitism and clumping - affects the platelet count!</p>
