### Erythropoiesis
- 0-2 months: yolk sac
- 2-7 months: liver and spleen
- 8 months and on: bone marrow of all bones
- Adults: predominantly axial skeleton.
- The liver and spleen never lose their capability for erythropoiesis, and can take over when the bone marrow is damage or in the setting of a myeloproliferative disorder. 
- Erythropoiesis is governed by erythropoietin, produced by the kidney and liver in response to low oxygen tension. Erythropoietin levels can be measured in the lab. Erythropoietin also bound to circulating erythrocytes. <strong>Hepcidin</strong> is produced in the liver and controls iron  absorption from the GI tract and iron release from macrophages. Iron must be released from bone marrow macrophages to be incorporated into the heme group of hemoglobin. Administration of erythropoietin has been associated with increased risk of both arterial and venous thrombosis, also been implicated in cancer progression in some studies due to increased blood flow to the tumor. 
- <strong>Normal hemoglobin production requires</strong>: intact bone marrow structure and function. Intact hormonal axis, including thyroid, erythropoietin, and adrenal steroids. Necessary nutrients including iron, folic acid, and cyanocobalamin. Normal red cell survival times, such that production keeps up with loses. No inborn errors in either globin or heme synthesis.</p>

### Symptoms of Anemia
- Depends on: <strong>speed of onset</strong>: anemia that develops slowly may be well tolerated. <strong>Severity</strong>, almost everyone will be symptomatic with a hemoglobin of 5 (one third of normal). <strong>Age of patient</strong>, older patients tolerate anemia poorer than a younger patient. <strong>Comorbidities,</strong> presence of cardiopulmonary comorbidity will develop symptoms sooner. <strong>Underlying cause</strong>: someone with B12 deficiency will have specific symptoms, e.g. neuropathy.
- Signs of anemia: <strong>General</strong>: pallor, conjunctival pallor. <strong>Hyperdynamic circulation</strong>: increase cardiac output to compensate for lower O<sub>2</sub> carrying capacity. <strong>Specific</strong>: spoon nails - iron deficiency anemia, jaundice - hemolytic anemia, peripheral neuropathy - B12 deficiency anemia.</p>

<p><span><br /></span>
### Causes of Anemia
- <strong>1. Blood loss</strong>: acute vs. chronic
- <strong>2. Decreased production</strong>: lack of necessary nutrients, hormonal deficiency, chronic inflammation, damaged stem cells, viral infection, myelophthisis (space-occupying bone marrow lesion), primary bone marrow disease.
- <strong>3. Decreased survival</strong>: <em>Intrinsic</em> to red cell: abnormal membrane, abnormal hemoglobin, abnormal enzymes. <em>Extrinsic</em> to red cell: antibody mediated destruction, hypersplenism / sequestration, disseminated intravascular coagulation, TTP/HUS, ESRD. </p>

<p><span><br /></span>
### Anemia and taking a history
- <strong>Diet</strong>: Vegan? Consider B12 deficiency. Malnutrition? Consider during chemotherapy.
- <strong>Medications</strong>: Aspirin (GI blood loss), NSAIDs (gastritis), antacids, anticoagulants, steroids
- <strong>Alcohol</strong>: leads to folate deficiency, affect liver function, directly suppress bone marrow function
- <strong>Family history</strong>: inherited syndromic anemias
- <strong>Surgery</strong>: gastrectomy, small bowel surgery
- <strong>Underlying chronic diseases</strong>: inflammatory disease, malignancy, renal disease
- <strong>Pediatrics</strong>: exposure to lead, pica, milk intake (decreases iron absorption)</p>

### Laboratory thought process / workup of anemia
- Look at old CBCs! Useful for establishing a time-line.
- Look at the entire CBC! - Is this an isolated anemia or are more than one cell line involved?
- Look at the indices! - Especially MCV (mean corpuscle volume, 80-100) and RDW (variation in size)
- Get a reticulocyte count! Bluish-colored cells are referred to as “polychromasia”
- Get a WBC differential!
- Ask for a peripheral smear to be made! Look for anisocytosis or poikilocytosis, inclusions within RBCs, abnormal WBCs
- You may need to progress to evaluation of the bone marrow, looking for: cellularity, infiltrative disease, iron storage, dysplasia, leukemia, myeloma, or fibrosis
- <strong>Bone marrow aplasia</strong>: represents damage to the myeloid stem cells that give rise to RBCs, granulocytes, monocytes, and megakaryocytes. Causes of bone marrow aplasia include: chemotherapy, radiotherapy, toxins (benzene), drugs (chloramphenical), infections, autoimmune disorder, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Prognosis depends on cause, age, and availability of bone marrow donor. Autoimmune-mediated aplastic anemia presents with pancytopenia with low reticulocyte count but with normal MCV. Diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out more common causes. Can be treated temporarily by immune suppression, treat long term with bone marrow transplant from allogeneic donor.</p>
