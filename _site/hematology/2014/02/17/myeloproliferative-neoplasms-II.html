<h3 id="re-visiting-hematopoiesis-with-focus-on-myeloid-lineage">Re-visiting hematopoiesis, with focus on myeloid lineage</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) and stem-cell leukemia factor (SCL) are required for the generation of fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the mesoderm. Defect in RUNX1 or SCL may lead to stem cell leukemia, but are not very common.</li>
  <li>Growth-factor independent 1 (GFI1) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) function in <strong>self-renewal</strong> of existing HSCs.</li>
  <li>Don’t need to know the exact name of all the transcription factors associated with the different linages, but know that he importance of these transcription factors have been proven in that mutations involving these transcription factors have been identified in patients with acute leukemia</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="acute-myeloid-leukemia-aml">Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Presentation</strong>: systemic symptoms related to cytopenias: weakness, fever, bleeding, or petechiae; symptoms related to organ involvement: headache, abdominal pain, bone pain, gum infiltration; or, may be detected incidentally. <strong>Critical care medicine</strong>: may also present as disseminated intravascular coagulation or leukostasis (treat with cytophoresis).</li>
  <li>Malignancy of the immature stages of one of the cells of the myeloid line: erythroblast, myeloblast, monoblast, or megakaryoblast.</li>
  <li>Rare, accounts for only 1-2% of cancer deaths in the USA.</li>
  <li>Mostly affects adults and increases with age (median age over 60), children typically get ALL more frequently though</li>
  <li>Not much progress in new therapeutics, with the exception of M3 (acute promyelocytic), which responds to trans-retinoic acid.</li>
  <li>History of diagnostics: morphologic to immunohistochemical to flow cytometry to cytogenetics.</li>
  <li><strong>FAB classification</strong>: uses morphology, immunohistochemistry, and cytogenetics. Follows developmental tree of the myeloid lineage: M0 (undifferentiated), M1 (myeloblastic without differentiation), M2 (early granulocytic differentiation), M3 (promyelocytic). M4 - M7 are more developed: myelo/monocytic, monocytic, erythroleukemic, megakaryocytic.</li>
  <li><strong>WHO classification</strong>: AML with genetic abnormalities, AML with multilineage dysplasia (these patients do much worse, disease may have evolved from MDS), MDS secondary to therapy related MDS, AML not otherwise categorized</li>
  <li>AML cytogenetic and molecular results have been grouped based on favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable prognostics.</li>
  <li><strong>Lab findings</strong>: Peripheral smear may show <strong>Auer rods</strong> which are peroxidase-positive inclusion bodies. Treatment of AML M3 may release the Auer rods, leading to DIC. Bone marrow will be “monotonous”.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="basic-principles-of-aml-treatment">Basic Principles of AML treatment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Complete bone marrow examination, including morphology, flow cytometry, and cytogenetics</li>
  <li>Establish central venous access, use triple lumen catheter</li>
  <li>Clinical assessment: performance status (will the patient tolerate chemotherapy?), physical examination, organ function tests (renal, cardiac, coagulation), rule out infection.</li>
  <li>Assessment of family members to be bone marrow donors.</li>
  <li>Choose chemotherapy based on <strong>bone marrow evaluation</strong>: either induction chemotherapy followed by consolidation chemotherapy, or induction chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplant if in an unfavorable prognostic group.</li>
  <li>Supportive are during chemotherapy and recovery (3 weeks!): growth factors, transfusions, prophylaxis (antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals).</li>
  <li><strong>Chemotherapy</strong>: for most AML subtypes, treatment of choice is <strong>cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C)</strong> and an <strong>anthracycline</strong>. Induction duration is 7 days of Ara-C followed by 3 days of anthracycline. If induction is successful, then patients receive consolidation dose (similar drugs for 2-4 cycles). “If you don’t get rid of that clone, it’s going to grow back.” One exception: <strong>M3 promyelocytic AML</strong> - use all trans-retinoic acid! (see below).</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="acute-promyelocytic-leukemia---m3-aml">Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia - M3 AML</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Characterized by promyelocytes which are rich in Auer rods.</li>
  <li>Cytogenetic characterization of reciprocal translocation <strong>t(15;17)</strong>; fusion protein binds to DNA and blocks transcription factors and differentiation. Both FISH and PCR can identify the APL/RAR fusion gene.</li>
  <li>M3 AML is <strong>unique</strong> in that it is sensitive to <strong>all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)</strong>, which has improved outcomes to approximately 90% cure in a disease previously entirely lethal. ATRA mechanism: dissociated oncogenic protein from DNA, allowing for transcription and <strong>differentiation.</strong> Still have to use chemotherapy afterwards to kill the stem cell though!</li>
  <li>Patients previously would die from DIC after promyelocyte destruction.</li>
  <li>Arsenic can also induce remission through similar mechanism of action.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="myelodysplastic-syndromes-mds">Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Heterogeneous group of <strong>clonal</strong> disorders typically in the older patient, characterized by <strong>variable cytopenias (pancytopenia vs. only 1-2 lines)</strong>, tendency to progress to AML.</li>
  <li>Patients are usually asymptomatic at presentation, but may present with complaint secondary to cytopenia or AML.</li>
  <li>Diagnosis clinched on bone marrow exam - not blood, hallmark is <strong>dysplasia</strong>. What is dysplasia? That depends on the cell type! See the following table:
&lt;div style="text-align:center;" markdown="1"&gt;

</ul>
<p>&lt;/div&gt;
- <strong>Classification</strong>: based on number of cell lines that are dysplastic, number of blasts present, chromosomal findings, whether or not there are ringed sideroblasts. There’s also a 5q<sup>-</sup> group that’s special and you can treat with thalidomide derivatives.
- <strong>Prognosis</strong>: Depends on WHO category (see above), % blasts, number of cytopenias, karyotype, and transfusion dependence. <strong>30% rule</strong>: 30% die from acute leukemia, 30% die from cytopenia complications, 30% die from old age.
- International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS): Sum of risk group scores is worse prognostication.
- <strong>Treatment</strong>: Treatment choice depends on patient status (comorbidities, performance) and risk stratification. Action might range from watchful waiting to supportive care to chemotherapy to bone marrow transplant. Supportive care includes judicious transfusions, management of iron overload, growth factor maintenance, and infection control. <strong>Chemotherapy</strong>: decitabine, 5-azacytidine, or lenalidomide for 5q<sup>-</sup>. These agents are <strong>hypomethylating nucleoside analogues</strong>, which function to restore activity of tumor suppressor genes.</p>
