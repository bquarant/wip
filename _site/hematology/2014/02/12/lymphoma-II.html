			<h3 id="todo">TODO</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Complete lecture objectives</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Recap immunology and reconsider in the light of neoplasm</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="lymphadenopathy">Lymphadenopathy</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Lymph nodes and the immune system can be the site of infectious, immunologic reactions, and neoplasms, either primary or metastatic.</li>
  <li>Clinical manifestations of lymph node pathology may include: local enlargement with or without tenderness, compression of adjacent structures (mass effect), or systemic symptoms of fever, weight loss, and night sweats due to cytokine release. </li>
  <li>Infectious organisms can stimulate acute, chronic, or granulomatous reactions in the draining lymph nodes.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="neoplastic-proliferations-of-wbcs">Neoplastic proliferations of WBCs</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Lymphoid lineage: precursor lymphoid neoplasms (primitive, B- or T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia); mature B-cell neoplasms (includes plasma cell disorders);  mature T-cell and NK-cell neoplasms; Hodgkin’s lymphoma; and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders. </li>
  <li>Myeloid origin: myeloproliferative neoplasms (effective hematopoiesis, counts go up), myelodysplastic neoplasm, myelodysplastic syndrome (ineffective hematopoiesis, counts go down), and acute myeloid leukemia.</li>
  <li>Can also be of histiocytic or dendritic origin…</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="clinical-features-of-patients-with-hematologic-malignancies">Clinical features of patients with hematologic malignancies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Systemic symptoms: malaise, fatigue, weight loss, fever</li>
  <li><strong>Organ infiltration</strong>: liver, lymph nodes, or spleen might be involved, leading to compromised organ function. Can be measured by noting increase in liver enzymes, for example. Skin, gums, and meninges can also be invaded, so do an oral exam and with ALL get a LP. <em>Pulmonary leukostasis</em>: seen in acute leukemia with very high counts (200+) pulmonary capillaries and arterioles become distended because they’re packed with blasts, leads to hypoxia and tissue ischemia.</li>
  <li><strong>Lymphadenopathy</strong>: depends on location; peripheral nodes might be palpable, central nodes may cause mass effect and obstruction of vital structures (SVCS, bowel or ureteral obstruction)</li>
  <li><strong>Bone marrow infiltration</strong>: bone pain, loss of normal hematopoietic elements (leading to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia).</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="clinical-characteristics---grading-and-classification">Clinical Characteristics - Grading and Classification</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Low Grade</strong>: process usually composed of cells that appear mature, more likely a chronic process, and longer life expectancy if untreated.</li>
  <li><strong>High Grade</strong>: immature cells, high mitotic rate, rapidly progressive, death in a short time, but may cure if aggressive therapy.</li>
  <li>Classification based on morphology, immunologic characteristics, clinical features (localized vs. disseminated, nodal vs. extranodal, indolent vs. aggressive), cell of origin, and genetic abnormalities.</li>
  <li>WHO classification: reflects best estimate of lineage, molecular characteristics, stage of differentiation, allows lymphomas and leukemias to be classified under one system</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="etiologic-and-pathogenetic-factors">Etiologic and Pathogenetic Factors</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Molecular abnormalities, chromosomal translocations, and oncogenes</strong>: most lymphomas and leukemias are associated with either activation of oncogene or loss of anti-oncogene. How they are acquired is yet unknown, likely due to a variety of mechanisms. See below for more!</li>
  <li><strong>Inherited genetic factors</strong>: Genomic instability disorders (Bloom syndrome, higher frequency of DNA breaks and rearrangements; Fanconi anemia, sensitivity to DNA damaging elements leading to aplastic anemia and increased incidence of neoplasm; Ataxia telangiectasia, Down Syndrome, Neurofibromatosis)</li>
  <li><strong>Viruses</strong>: <em>HTLV-1</em>, leading to adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in 2-5% of positive individuals. ATLL characterized by diffuse lymphadenopathy, hyperlobated pleomorphic lymphocytes. Most common in Japan, Caribbean. Survival less than 1 year. <em>HHV-8</em>, leading to Kaposi’s sarcoma. HHV-8 has also been implicated in primary effusion lymphoma as well.</li>
  <li><strong>Infections or chronic antigenic stimulation</strong>: environmental agents cause chronic inflammation, predisposing the individual to lymphoid proliferation, cytogenetic abnormalities, and neoplasia. Example 1: <em>H. pylori</em> and gastric MALT lymphomas; while there is a significant connection between H. pylori and gastric carcinoma, the stomach also develops lymphoid tissue in response to H. pylori infection, postulated mechanism suggests that there is an induction of lymphoid infiltration and formation of a malignant clone. Eradicate the tumor by using antibiotics! Example 2: Gluten-sensitive enteropathy and intestinal T-cell lymphoma</li>
  <li><strong>Immune dysfunction</strong>: Sustained B-cell stimulation due to immune dysregulation may increase risk of oncogenic events; diminished T-cell dependent immune surveillance may also contribute to this risk (i.e. EBV).</li>
  <li><strong>Environmental agents</strong>: solvents, organic chemicals, pesticides</li>
  <li><strong>Iatrogenic factors</strong>: chemotherapy or radiation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="specific-examples">Specific Examples</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)</strong> - First consistent chromosomal anomaly detected in cancer, t(9;22) Philadelphia chromosome, leads to BCR/Abl Fusion gene with increased activity of tyrosine kinase, leading to cell proliferation. Gleevec (imatinib) is the magic bullet!</li>
  <li><strong>Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (AML)</strong>* - t(15;17) defines this process, gives rise to a PML-RAR-alpha gene fusion product, which have been targeted directly using trans-retionic acid derivatives.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="cytogenetic-abnormalities-and-lymphoma">Cytogenetic Abnormalities and Lymphoma</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cytogenetic abnormalities have been identified for almost all lyphomas, most involve reciprocal translocations involving either <strong>oncogenes</strong> or <strong>antigen receptor genes</strong> that lymphocytes use to generate proteins capable of detecting diverse foreign antigens.</li>
  <li>Many cytogenetic abnormalities are characteristic of a particular type of lymphoma</li>
  <li><strong>Follicular lymphoma</strong> - t(14;18), involves Bcl-2 oncogene. Memory cells should express Bcl-2, because that keeps them alive and gives you better immunologic memory, but cells in the germinal center should not. Normal Bcl-2 lymph node stain is negative in the center, positive in the mantle. Follicular lymphoma Bcl-2 stain is positive throughout.</li>
  <li><strong>Burkitt lymphoma</strong> - high grade lymphoma, t(8;14). MYC proto-oncogene translocated with immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene, results in very high proliferative activity. “The most rapidly dividing tumor afflicting man,”</li>
