<h3 id="revisiting-hemoglobin-the-magnificent-hemoglobinopathies">Revisiting Hemoglobin The Magnificent; Hemoglobinopathies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“Everything it does helps everything it does”</li>
  <li><strong>Hemoglobinopathies</strong> are the inherited disorders of hemoglobin, including diseases such as sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia, and are amongst the most common single-gene disorders on the planet.</li>
  <li><em>Hemoglobinopathy classification</em>: <strong>structural variants</strong> - abnormal protein structure (~750 known conditions), <strong>thalassemias</strong> -  decreased synthesis of an otherwise normal alpha or beta chain, <strong>defective developmental switching</strong> - hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH).</li>
  <li><strong>FFT</strong>: Hemoglobin biophysics: Oxygen binds well where there is high oxygen saturation (i.e. lungs), oxygen does not bind well where there is low oxygen saturation (i.e. tissue). How does this happen? Allosteric effects: positive homotropic effect, negative heterotropic effecc</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="fetal-vs-adult-hemoglobin">Fetal vs. Adult Hemoglobin</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Parental units each contribute the following set: 2 x α, 1 x β, 1 x δ, 2 x γ, for a diploid 4 x α, 2 x β, 2 x δ, and 4  x γ. Having 4 x α and 4 x γ is clinically relevant.  </li>
  <li>Fetal hemoglobin is usually α<sub>2</sub>γ<sub>2</sub>, adult usually α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub> 98%, α<sub>2</sub>δ<sub>2</sub> 2%.</li>
  <li>Alpha and beta chains are homologous; gamma and delta chains are strongly homologous to beta chains and substitute for beta chains in adult and fetal hemoglobin. Genes arose due to gene duplications.</li>
  <li><strong>FFT</strong>: hemoglobin is always a tetramer, containing two alpha-like chains and two beta-like chains, each subunit has a heme group with a Fe<sup>2+</sup> that can bind one O<sub>2</sub>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="hemoglobinopathies---the-structural-variants">Hemoglobinopathies - The Structural Variants</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sickle syndromes</strong> - sickle cell anemia and trait. All patients will have at least one β<sup>s</sup> gene, some may have <strong>HbSC</strong> disease or <strong>HbS/β-thalassemia</strong> disease.</li>
  <li><strong>Unstable hemoglobins</strong> - precipitation of hemoglobin within the RBCs leads to congenital Heinz body hemolytic anemia (CHBA), more than 100 variants known about half of which lead to structural abnormalities with clinical symptoms.</li>
  <li><strong>Abnormal oxygen affinity</strong> - <em>high affinity hemoglobins</em>: more common, more detected, more serious. <em>low affinity hemoglobins</em> - less detected, fewer clinical symptoms.</li>
  <li><strong>Methemoglobinemias</strong> - defect near the heme-Fe<sup>2+</sup> binding site on α or β subunits, leading to Fe<sup>3+</sup>, which cannot reversibly bind O<sub>2</sub>. At least 6 variants known.</li>
  <li><strong>Structural variants with thalassemia phenotype</strong> - like the thalassemias, with less α- or β-chains, but it’s not due to decreased synthesis of otherwise normal chains; rather, it’s due to decreased synthesis of <em>abnormal</em> chains, due to either nonsense mutation, elongated protein, or hemoglobin Lepore (fusion of β and δ genes).</li>
  <li><strong>General overview</strong>: β-chain mutations are the most common detected, α-chain less common due to having 4 genes to accommodate.  γ-chain mutations harder to detect due to fetal utility and having four genes. There are only a few δ-chain mutations found, without known functions. Most hemoglobin variants are due to <strong>point mutations leading to single amino acid substitutions</strong>, but termination, insertion, deletion, and frame-shift mutations have all been detected.</li>
  <li>“Hemoglobinopathies are representative of other inherited diseases of globular proteins, with autosomal recessive inheritance patterns and heterozygotes usually being relatively healthy.”</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="practical-classification-of-hemoglobin-variants-by-clinical-consequences">Practical classification of hemoglobin variants by clinical consequences</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Polymorphic variants</strong>: At least 1% of the population has the variant; major public health problem in affected communities. HbS, HbC, and HbE are polymorphic traits.  α- and β-thalassemia, although they’re not structural variants, are also polymorphic traits due to their frequencies in specific populations. “Type A hemoglobinopathy: high incidence”</li>
  <li><strong>Oxygen carrying variants</strong>: High O<sub>2</sub> affinity - poor oxygen release, leads to secondary polycythemia. Low O<sub>2</sub> affinity and the methemoglobinemias will lead to cyanosis. “Type B hemoglobinopathy: polycythemia or cyanosis”</li>
  <li><strong>Unstable variants</strong>: “Type C hemoglobinopathy: hemolytic anemia”</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="sickle-cell-anemia">Sickle cell anemia</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Point mutation causing amino acid shift from glutamate to valine on the beta chain.</li>
  <li><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: family history, clinical symptoms, electrophoresis.</li>
  <li><strong>Pathophysiology</strong>: before aggregation, hemoglobin binds and releases O<sub>2</sub> normally; however, de-oxyhemoglobin polymerizes. Rate is slow due to high delta-G of transition state of polymerized form. Usually, blood flows through capillaries faster than the polymerization can occur, thus sickle cell crises are episodic. Vaso-occlusive crises occur when HbS polymerization leads to erythrocyte sickling, making them rigid and inflexible, occluding capillaries leading to infarction. </li>
  <li>Sickle RBCs are fragile and have a shortened life span, leading to chronic hemolytic anemia, processed in the spleen.</li>
  <li><strong>Treatment</strong>: Analgesics for pain relief. IV hydration to prevent Hb polymerization and kidney damage. Severe cases get <strong>hydroxyurea</strong> to increase fetal hemoglobin and reduce HbS aggregation, and prophylactic <strong>penicillin</strong>. Aggressive management of vaso-occlusive crises: stroke, acute chest syndrome, priapism, consider start patient on <strong>iron chelation therapy</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Prognosis</strong>: Consider damage to renal medulla (loss of water balance control), atrophic spleen, and cardiac hypertrophy due to chronic anemia.</li>
  <li><strong>Other facts</strong>: HbS-trait heterozygotes usually symptom free. There is selective advantage of HbS and HbS heterozygote in malaria due to parasite not being able to complete life cycle in altered cell; thus, the HbS gene is polymorphic in areas where malaria is endemic.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="hemoglobin-c-and-hbsc-disease">Hemoglobin C and HbSC disease</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Point mutation causing amino acid shift from glutamate to lysine on the beta chain. Molecular biology suggests that this disease will be less severe than HbS; mutation with a charged amino acid (despite oppositely charged) is expected to be less detrimental than mutation involving a non-polar amino acid substitution. </li>
  <li><strong>Presentation</strong>: mild hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly, vaso-occlusive episodes tend to involve the eye, leading to blindness. Other possible manifestations include aseptic necrosis of the femoral and humeral heads, and possibly acute chest syndrome.</li>
  <li><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: protein electrophoresis. HbSC disease is more serious than HbC disease!</li>
  <li>Common in West Africa.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="sickle-cell--beta-thalassemia-disease">Sickle cell / Beta-Thalassemia Disease</h3>
<ul>
  <li>β-thalassemia genes inherited can either be  β<sup>0</sup> where no chains are made, or  β<sup>+</sup> where just less chains are made, leading to β<sup>S</sup>β<sup>0</sup> phenotype which is similar to sickle cell disease, or β<sup>S</sup>β<sup>+</sup> phenotype, which is similar to sickle cell trait.</li>
  <li>Rare case where “two diseases are better than one!”</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="hbe-disease">HbE disease</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Most common hemoglobin variant, found in Thailand, Laos, Burma, and Bangladesh.</li>
  <li>Point mutation causing amino acid shift from glutamate to lysine at β<sub>26</sub>, leading to a s structural change and decreased synthesis. Also, splice error due to mutations in exon near splice site.</li>
  <li>Homozygotes are asymptomatic but can evidence a slight anemia; however, Hb β<sup>Thal</sup>β<sup>E</sup> can be problematic due to net decrease in beta chains.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="unstable-hemoglobins">Unstable Hemoglobins</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Single-amino acid substitutions that disrupt normal protein folding, leading to insoluble protein complexes which precipitate in the RBC to form inclusion (Heinz) bodies, which make the RBC less flexible and thus more fragile within the spleen.</li>
  <li><strong>C</strong>ongenital <strong>H</strong>einz <strong>B</strong>ody <strong>A</strong>nemia (CHBA) - hemolytic anemia</li>
  <li>Hemoglobin chains typically have 7-8 helical regions, sequences that form alpha-helices usually have a central sequence rich in hydrophobic amino acids. 13 unstable hemoglobin variants have mutations leading to the introduction of <strong>proline</strong>, which forces a bend and breaks the helix.</li>
  <li><strong>Hb Hammersmith</strong> - β<sub>42</sub> Phe to Ser, aromatic to polar uncharged, leads to poor heme binding. Only heterozygotes known.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="hemoglobins-with-abnormal-high-oxygen-affinity">Hemoglobins with abnormal (HIGH) oxygen affinity</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hb McKees-Rock</strong>: β<sub>145</sub> Tyr to STOP. This is the tyrosine that “pops” out of a hydrophobic pocket when O<sub>2</sub> binds to normal hemoglobin; this mutation leads to the breaking of salt links that facility T to R state conversion as a part of the positive homotropic effect. </li>
  <li>Note: if the last two residues are deleted, then no stable T-state can be formed at all, thus, hemoglobin locked in the R-state </li>
  <li>Hb McKee’s Rock should be thought of as a <strong>loss of positive homotropic effect</strong> means Hb is always stuck in R-state (relaxed) and thus has high affinity for oxygen. Only heterozygotes known, and the body will compensate by just making more RBCs (secondary polycythemia/erythrocytosis)</li>
  <li><strong>Hb Hiroshima</strong>: β<sub>146</sub> His to Asp. Leads to <strong>loss of negative heterotropic effect</strong> of H<sup>+</sup>, leading to O<sub>2</sub> release decreased and O<sub>2</sub> affinity increase. Survival depends on heterozygosity and compensation with secondary polycythemia.</li>
  <li><strong>Hb Syracuse</strong>: β<sub>143</sub> His to Pro. Decreased binding affinity of BPG leads to less T-state stabilization, more R-state stabilization, and thus higher O<sub>2</sub> binding affinity. Again, survival depends on heterozygosity and secondary polycythemia.</li>
  <li><strong>Hb Kempsey</strong>: β<sub>99</sub> Asn to Asp. At α1β2 interface.  Large allosteric effect driven movement is prohibited, locking hemoglobin in the R-state. Again, survival depends on heterozygosity and compensation leads to secondary polycythemia.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="hemoglobins-with-abnormal-low-oxygen-affinity">Hemoglobins with abnormal (LOW) oxygen affinity</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fewer low-affinity hemoglobin variants are known compared with the high-affinity variants, likely due to less severe clinical course.</li>
  <li><strong>Hb Kansas</strong>: β<sub>102</sub> Asn to Thr, also at α1β2 interface. Essentially the opposite of Hb Kempsey, makes the R-state quaternary structure unstable and locks the hemoglobin into the T-state. Hb Kansas binds oxygen worse, but releases oxygen better. The <strong>cyanosis</strong> is likely due to increased O<sub>2</sub> release in the tissues rather than decreased saturation in the lungs. </li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="the-methemoglobins">The Methemoglobins</h3>
<ul>
  <li>There are two His residues on either side of the flat heme prosthetic group, one binds to the Fe<sup>2+</sup> atom, and moves when the O<sub>2</sub> binds, thus beginning the chain of events that leads to the positive homotropic effect. The other His residue is nearby, but does not bind the iron of a normal hemoglobin molecule.</li>
  <li>4 of the 6 methemoglobin mutations are at the His residue on either the α- or β-chain.</li>
  <li><strong>Tyrosine</strong>’s hydroxyl group is likely the culprit behind the shift between Fe<sup>3+</sup> binding instead of Fe<sup>2+</sup>.</li>
  <li>Only Fe<sup>2+</sup> binds O<sub>2</sub> reversibly; and the erythrocyte has a metabolic system designed to keep Fe<sup>2+</sup> in its reduced state.</li>
  <li><strong>Presentation</strong>: Cyanosis, due to decreased amount of oxy-Fe<sup>2+</sup>-hemoglobin. Otherwise asymptomatic, survival and thriving due to heterozygosity.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="structural-variants-with-thalassemic-phenotype">Structural variants with Thalassemic Phenotype</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hb Lepore</strong>: N-terminal normal delta-chain fused with C-terminal normal beta-chain, leads to new beta-like chain and decreased amount of beta-chain.</li>
  <li>Fusion gene mutations occur during crossing over.</li>
  <li>Symptoms are similar to moderate to severe beta-thalassemia.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="the-thalassemias">The Thalassemias</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Decreased synthesis</strong> of otherwise normal alpha or beta chains.</li>
  <li>Both alpha- and beta-thalassemias are polymorphic traits, with high incidences in specific populations. Alpha-thalassemias prevalent in China, beta-thalassemias prevalent in India and Mediterranean. Thalassemia populations follow distribution of the mosquito in hot, humid climates.</li>
  <li><strong>alpha-thalassemias</strong>: generally due to gene deletion. Unlike beta-thalassemia, alpha-thalassemia can effect fetal hemoglobin, leads to <strong>hydrops fetalis</strong> if there are no alpha-chains (all 4 deleted!), leads to severe intrauterine hypoxia and fatal H<sub>2</sub>O accumulation in brain and other organs. <strong>Gamma<sub>4</sub>-homotetramers</strong> form, but cannot release O<sub>2</sub>. Alpha-thalassemia after birth make beta<sub>4</sub>-homotetramers, which precipitate as Heinz bodies, lead to hemolytic anemia. Severity of anemia correlates with number of alpha-globin genes deleted!</li>
  <li><strong>beta-thalassemias</strong>: over 200 different point mutations known, characterized by decreased amount of Beta-globin; most due to mRNA amounts ( promoter mutation leading to decreased transcription, other processing defects, less common are translation problem). Alpha<sub>4</sub>-homotetramers form and precipitate, leading to hemolytic anemia with hypochromic, microcytic cells. Effects only seen after birth, due to regulation changes. <strong>Beta-thalassemia minor</strong>: β<sup>A</sup>β<sup>Thal</sup> genotype. Slightly anemic, usually clinically OK. HbA<sub>2</sub> levels increase in heterozygotes, is diagnostic. Dangerous to give iron!!! <strong>Beta-thalassemia major</strong>: single-base pair substitutions. Homozygotes have two  β<sup>Thal</sup> alleles, and often not the same. β<sup>0</sup>-Thal make no beta-chains, no HbA<sub>1</sub>. β<sup>+</sup>-Thal make some beta-chains, some HbA<sub>1</sub>. <strong>Prognosis</strong>: decreased life expectancy. <strong>Treatment</strong>: require transfusions but might become iron overloaded due to this procedure, so use iron chelation (desferoxamine) before liver and cardiac toxicity develop. Bone marrow transplant.</li>
  <li>Clinical hallmark: <strong>imbalance</strong> in amounts of alpha- or beta-chain. Excess amount of the normal chain precipitates, leading to hemolytic anemia.</li>
  <li><strong>Labs</strong>: hypochromic, microcytic anemia!</li>
  <li><strong>Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobinemia</strong>: Normally, switch from gamma to beta gene expression at approximately 36 weeks gestation. In HPFH, switch does not occur, leading to increased levels of gamma chains and therefore high HbF (alpha2, gamma2). Clinically, not serious, may lead to secondary polycythemia. Medical research significance: if you can find out what turns on HbF in HPFH, then you might be able to help the Thalassemias.</li>
  <li><strong>Futures</strong>: An enhancer that specifically regulates expression of BCL11A in developing red cells was recently discovered; disruption of this enhancer would lead to depletion of BCL11A, in turn leading to large increases in HbF expression, and may be a possible treatment for SCD and B-thalassemia major.</li>
