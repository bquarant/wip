			<h3 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The major mediators of repair: VEGF, bFGF, TGF-beta, SPARC, angiostatin, thrombospondin</li>
  <li>The special types of wound healing</li>
  <li>The purpose of healing and repair, and disadvantages</li>
  <li>Healing by primary vs. secondary intention</li>
  <li>Three types of tissue regeneration</li>
  <li>Three basic ways tissue may heal</li>
  <li>Abnormal wound healing</li>
  <li>What gives a healing surgical incision strength</li>
  <li>Use of CRP and ESR in assessing healing</li>
  <li><strong>Definitions</strong>: granuloma, granulation tissue, angiogenesis, scar, keloid, proud flesh, dystrophic calcification, dehiscence, pyogenic granuloma, incisional hernia, cirrhosis</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="healing-is-not-a-science-but-the-art-of-wooing-nature">“Healing is not a science but the art of wooing nature”</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The three basic outcomes after tissue injury: <strong>reconstruction, partial reconstruction, or scar formation</strong></li>
  <li>Reconstruction: regeneration of tissue</li>
  <li>Partial reconstruction: some regeneration, some scar.</li>
  <li>Scar formation: clinical significance depends on location (i.e. scar in the heart that is instantly fatal vs. a superficial skin scar).</li>
  <li>Purposes of repair: stop bleeding, prevent infection, fill in the defect (e.g., laceration), pull tissue back together (through wound contraction)</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="tissue-regeneration">Tissue Regeneration</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The more regeneration, the less scar. Cell regeneration is largely under the influence of growth factors.</li>
  <li>Regeneration depends on tissue type. <strong>Labile</strong> cells have constant turnover and replacement, but a short life span (e.g. bone marrow, epithelium, epidermis). <strong>Stable cells</strong>: able to turn over if stimulated (i.e. bone, hepatocytes). <strong>Permanent cells</strong>: little ability to turn over (i.e. muscle, nerve).</li>
  <li>Epidermis is labile, but scar formation still?! Resolving the paradox: the scar is formed from lower dermal layers!</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="scar-formation">Scar Formation</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Granulation tissue</strong> (don’t confuse with granuloma <em>test</em>): defintion - numerous vessels that look like granules. Composed of proliferating capillaries (stimulated by <strong>VEGF and BFGF</strong> made by macrophages, themselves being stimulated by <strong>HIF</strong>), fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, extracellular matrix, and inflammatory cells (mostly macrophages).</li>
  <li>Angiogenesis: breakdown of the basement membrane around the existing vessels, migration and chemotaxis of endothelial cells (“sprout”), proliferation mediated by <strong>VEGF and BFGF</strong>, lumen formation, and then finally increased permeability through gaps and transcytosis leading to <strong>edema</strong>.</li>
  <li>Other facts about angiogenesis: (1) angioblasts can come from the bone marrow and start this process, but also just like the diagram endothelial cells do it too. Signaling molecules: <strong>VEGF</strong> is an early factor, Ang1 later, and Ang2 is a late inhibitory signal. <strong>VEGF</strong> </li>
  <li>Granulation tissue is weak and is eventually broken down by matrix metalloproteinases, serine proteases, and elastases. Vessels are gradually reduced in number (scars are avascular) and inhibited by <strong>Ang2</strong>. Macrophages begin to produce FGFs and TGF-B, which stimulate fibroblast proliferation and migration. Fibroblasts begin making collagen, initially Type III collage and later converted to Type I collagen which is stronger. Wound strength a proportion of cross-linking.</li>
  <li>Disadvantages: not as strong as original tissue. Data shows that surgical sutured wound strength is only going to get about 80% of baseline after three months. Scars also may interfere with function (see: heart and kidney infarcts), or they may be disfiguring.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="wound-healing">Wound Healing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Healing by primary intention: minimal tissue separation, e.g. sutured wound.</li>
  <li>Healing by secondary intention: greater tissue separation, e.g, tooth socket.</li>
  <li>Q: Why is the scar white? A: There are no vessels!</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="special-types-of-wound-healing">Special types of wound healing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fibrosis without granulation tissue: hyalinized renal glomeruli in DM, scarring in granulomas.</li>
  <li>Unique patterns of fibrosis: cirrhosis of the liver, tumor encapsulation.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="variants-and-complications-of-normal-wound-healing">Variants and complications of normal wound healing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Excessive granulation tissue: <strong>pyogenic granuloma or “proud flesh”</strong>, looks like a large, well-cirumscribed red raised plaque Angiogenesis seems to be driving this process, likely mediated by FLT-4, a VEGF ligand.</li>
  <li>Excessive scar tissue: Hypertrophic or keloid scar, looks kind of a like a tumor. More common in African Americans. Current thought is that it is related to <strong>WNT</strong> activation, which prevents <strong>b-catenin</strong> degradation, which leads to fibroblast proliferation.</li>
  <li>Defective scar formation: herniation of the wound, wound dehiscence, failure of wound closure</li>
  <li><strong>Dystrophic calcification</strong>: deposition of calcium in the tissue. Seen in atherosclerosis, aging heart valves, granulomas, tumors. Occurs at site of injury. Basophilic (i.e. blue)! Intracellular: starts in the mitochondria. Extracellular: starts with dead cells. Calcium binds to membrane or vesicular phosophlipids. Phosphatases generate phosphate, <strong>CaPO<sub>4</sub></strong> microcrystals form, cycle repeats. <strong>Crystallization propagation</strong> occurs, forming deposits. Matrix proteins like <strong>osteopontin</strong> facilitate the propagation.</li>
  <li><strong>Causes of delayed wound healing</strong>: infection, foreign material, size or location of wound,  aging, diabetes, poor blood supply (i.e. vascular disease), nutrition,</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="advances-in-wound-treatment">Advances in wound treatment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Silver (silvadene): topical antimicrobial, used in burn treatment</li>
  <li>Smart dressings: contain growth factors like PDGF (becaplemin)</li>
  <li>Negative pressure devices: provides a sealed, protected moist environment</li>
  <li>Hyperbaric chamber</li>
  <li>Platelet rich plasma (PRP): contains growth factors and platelets, orthopedists now injecting this directly into the surgical field</li>
</ul>
