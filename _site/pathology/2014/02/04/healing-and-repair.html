<ul>
<li>ReconstructioN; regeneration of tissue</li>

<li>Partial reconstruction: some regeneration, some scar.</li>

<li>Scar formation: clinical significance depends on location (i.e. scar in the heart is instantly fatal vs. superficial skin).</li>

<li>Purposes of repair: stop bleeding, prevent infection, fill in the defect (ie laceration), pull tissue back together (through wound contraction)</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='tissue_regeneration'>Tissue Regeneration</h3>

<ul>
<li>The more regeneration, the less scar.</li>

<li>Regeneration depends on tissue type. <strong>Labile</strong> cells have constant turnover and replacement, but a short life span (e.g. bone marrow, epithelium, epidermis). <strong>Stable cells</strong>: able to turn over if stimulated (i.e. bone, hepatocytes). <strong>Permanent cells</strong>: little ability to turn over (i.e. muscle, nerve).</li>

<li>Epidermis is labile, but scar formation still?! Resolving the paradox: the scar is formed from lower dermal layers!</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='scar_formation'>Scar Formation</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Granulation tissue</strong> (don&#8217;t confuse with granuloma <em>test</em>): defintion - numerous vessels that look like granules. Composed of proliferating capillaries (stimulated by <strong>VEGF and BFGF</strong> made by macrophages, themselves being stimulated by <strong>HIF</strong>), fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, extracellular matrix, and inflammatory cells (mostly macrophages).</li>

<li>Angiogenesis: breakdown of the basement membrane around the existing vessels, migration and chemotaxis of endothelial cells (&#8220;sprout&#8221;), proliferation mediated by <strong>VEGF and BFGF</strong>, lumen formation, and then finally increased permeability through gaps and transcytosis leading to <strong>edema</strong>.</li>

<li>Other facts about angiogenesis: (1) angioblasts can come from the bone marrow and start this process, but also just like the diagram endothelial cells do it too. Signaling molecules: <strong>VEGF</strong> is an early factor, Ang1 later, and Ang2 is a late inhibitory signal. <strong>VEGF</strong></li>

<li>Granulation tissue is weak and is eventually broken down by matrix metalloproteinases, serine proteases, and elastases. Vessels are gradually reduced in number (scars are avascular) and inhibited by <strong>Ang2</strong>. Macrophages begin to produce FGFs and TGF-B, which stimulate fibroblast proliferation and migration. Fibroblasts begin making collagen, initially Type III collage and later converted to Type I collagen which is stronger. Wound strength a proportion of cross-linking.</li>

<li>Disadvantages: not as strong as original tissue. Data shows that surgical sutured wound strength is only going to get about 80% of baseline after three months. Scars also may interfere with function (see: heart and kidney infarcts), or they may be disfiguring.</li>

<li>Healing by primary intention: minimal tissue separation, e.g.</li>

<li>Healing by secondary intention</li>

<li>Q: Why is the scar white? A: There are no vessels!</li>

<h3 id='special_types_of_wound_healing'>Special types of wound healing</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fibrosis without granulation tissue: hyalinized renal glomeruli in DM, scarring in granulomas.</li>

<li>Unique patterns of fibrosis: cirrhosis of the liver, tumor encapsulation.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='variants_and_complications_of_normal_wound_healing'>Variants and complications of normal wound healing</h3>

<ul>
<li>Excessive granulation tissue: Likely mediated by FLT-4, a VEGF ligand.</li>

<li>Excessive scar tissue: Hypertrophic or keloid scar, looks kind of a like a tumor. More common in African Americans. Current thought is that it is related to <strong>WNT</strong> activation, which prevents <strong>b-catenin</strong> degradation, which leads to fibroblast proliferation.</li>

<li>Defective scar formation: herniation of the wound, wound dehiscence, failure of wound closure</li>

<li>Dystrophic calcification: deposition of calcium in the tissue. Seen in atherosclerosis, aging heart valves, granulomas, tumors. Occurs at site of injury. Basophilic (i.e. blue)! Intracellular: starts in the mitochondria. Extracellular: starts with dead cells. Calcium binds to membrane or vesicular phosophlipids. Phosphatases generate phosphate, <strong>CaPO<sub>4</sub></strong> microcrystals form, cycle repeats. <strong>Crystallization propagation</strong> occurs, forming deposits. Matrix proteins like <strong>osteopontin</strong> facilitate the propagation.</li>

<li>Delayed wound healing: infection, aging, diabetes, poor blood supply (i.e. vascular disease).</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='advances_in_wound_treatment'>Advances in wound treatment</h3>

<ul>
<li>Silver (silvadene): topical antimicrobial</li>

<li>Smart dressings: contain growth factors like PDGF (becaplemin)</li>

<li>Negative pressure devices: provides a sealed, protected moist environment</li>

<li>Hyperbaric chamber</li>

<li>Platelet rich plasma (PRP): contains growth factors and platelets, orthopods now injecting this directly into the surgical field</li>
