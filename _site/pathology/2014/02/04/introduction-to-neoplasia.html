<ul>
<li>complete!</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='introductory_definitions'>Introductory definitions</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Benign neoplasm</strong>: gross and microscopic characteristics suggest it will remain localized. Well-circumscribed, slow clonal expansile growth, usually no necrosis, insignificant effect on host (but location dependent). Absent metastasis.</li>

<li><strong>Malignant neoplasm</strong>: gross and microscopic characteristics indicate it has the capability to infiltrate and destroy adjacent structures as well as spread to distant sites. Gross appearance is irregular, variable and often rapid invasive growth pattern, necrosis is often present, and there is a significant effect on the host. Metastasis is characteristic.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='histologic_origin_of_neoplasms'>Histologic origin of neoplasms</h3>

<ul>
<li>Neoplasms may arise from any tissue in the body, especially from <strong>cells that are normally actively proliferating</strong>. May be grouped based on histologic origin.</li>

<li><em>Epithelia</em>: glandular or squamous</li>

<li><em>Mesenchymal</em>: bone, cartilage, blood vessels</li>

<li><em>Neuroectoderm</em></li>

<li><em>Hematopoietic</em> or <em>lymphoid</em></li>

<li><em>Germ cells</em></li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='rules_of_nomenclature'>Rules of nomenclature</h3>

<ul>
<li>All tumors are comprised of the tumor cells (parenchyma) and the supporting tissue (stroma)</li>

<li>The cell or tissue of is the primary descriptor of any tumor, and forms the prefix of the tumor name.</li>

<li>Benign tumors, both epithelial and mesenchymal, are identified by the suffix <strong>&#8220;-oma&#8221;</strong>. Exceptions being melanoma, lymphoma, mesothelioma, seminoma, or hepatoma.</li>

<li>Malignant epithelial tumors are identified by <strong>-carcinoma</strong></li>

<li>Malignant mesenchymal tumors are identified by <strong>-sarcoma</strong></li>

<li>Secondary descriptors: refer to the tumor architecture (gross or microscopic), matrix, or function. Examples: papillary, cystic, polypoid (three-sided growth), scirrhous, desmoplastic, mucinous, colloid.</li>

<li><strong>Differentiation</strong>: refers to the degree of morphologic resemblance to the tissue or cell of origin. <em>Well differentiated</em> look similar to cell of origin, <em>poorly differentiated</em> bear little resemblance to the cell of origin.</li>

<li><strong>Anaplasia</strong>: the far end of the spectrum of poor differentiation, characterized by <em>pleomorphism</em> or variation in cell size and shape, abnormal nuclear morphology, and rapid proliferation (measured by mitoses). Typically unable to identify a lineage, aggressive neoplasms.</li>

<li>Also, there&#8217;s eponyms: Hodgkin&#8217;s disease (lymphoma), Ewings sarcoma (pediatric bone cancer).</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='neoplasia_concepts'>Neoplasia concepts</h3>

<ul>
<li>Four major stages: malignant chance in the tumor cell (transformation), cell growth, local invasion, distant metastasis.</li>

<li>Cellular reactions to stimuli: atrophy, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, metaplasia, dysplasia, neoplasia. Be able to sketch these all out!</li>

<li>Example: intra-epithelial neoplasia: many epithelial tumors originate as local dysplastic cell proliferations within the epithelium. These proliferations can be seen to undergo a predictable progression of intra-epithelial growth, populated by abnormal basal cells taking up more and more epithelial thickness. When neoplastic cells occupy the full thickness, it is called <strong>carcinoma in situ</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Invasion</strong> is the process of a malignant tumor growing beyond its basement membrane, giving it access to blood vessels and lymphatics in order to spread further.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='tumor_grading'>Tumor grading</h3>

<ul>
<li>Uses a combination of histologic features (mitotic activity, nuclear size, nuclear shape, presence of nucleoli, cell architecture) which predicts biologic behavior.</li>

<li>The specifics of the grading system depends on the tumor type, but there&#8217;s typically 3 or 4 grade levels.</li>

<li>Note: tumor grading has <strong>less clinical value</strong> than tumor staging.</li>

<li>Example: Breast cancer - sum score based on tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic count.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='tumor_staging'>Tumor staging</h3>

<ul>
<li>Staging utilizes tumor parameters of size, spread to lymph nodes and presence of distant metastases.</li>

<li>More reliable prognostically than grading.</li>

<li>TNM system is most widespread.</li>

<li><strong>T</strong>: tumor size. T0 = occult tumor, Tis = carcinoma in situ.</li>

<li><strong>N</strong>: number and distribution of lymph node metastases.</li>

<li><strong>M</strong>: distant non-lymphoid metastasis</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='effects_of_tumors'>Effects of tumors</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Local effects</strong>: <em>Ulcer</em> leading to hemorrhage. <em>Pain</em> due to compression or infiltration of nerve. <em>Obstruction</em> of lung causing pneumonia, of bile duct causing jaundice. <em>Sepsis</em> due to intestinal perforation. <em>Edema</em> due to obstruction of lymphatics. <em>Sensorimotor deficit</em> due to compression of nerve trunk.</li>

<li><strong>Systemic effects</strong>: <em>Cachexia</em> due to tumor cytokine release, notably TNF. <em>Coagulopathy</em> due to hypercoagulable state and migrating thromboses. <em>Dermatomyosis</em> skin rash and myopathies, auto-immune mediated. <em>Membranous glomerulonephritis</em>. <em>Fever</em> of unknown origin.</li>

<li><strong>Paraneoplastic syndrome</strong>: disease or symptom that is due to presence of neoplasm but not due to local presence of the tumor. Mediated by <strong>humoral factors</strong> (hormones, cytokines) secreted by the tumor or immune response against the tumor. May proceed diagnosis of the tumor. Examples: Cushing&#8217;s syndrome (ATCH mediated) but due to SCLC.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='laboratory_role_in_the_evaluation_of_neoplasm'>Laboratory role in the evaluation of neoplasm</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Surgical pathology</strong>: biopsy, resection, and cytologic preparation.</li>

<li>Routine vs. specialized stains. Immunohistochemical methods. Molecular diagnostics - Serum protein &#8220;tumor&#8221; markers. Example used in lecture was of PSA. Theoretically if the PSA is elevated, and prostatectomy is successful, PSA should go down. If PSA found to be re-elevated, tumor recurrence vs. metastasis.</li>
