			<h3 id='objectives'>Objectives</h3>

<ul>
<li>Recognize the broad span of lymphoid tissues from scatter, independent lymphocytes to solitary lymphoid nodules (e.g. in the gastrointestinal tract) to aggregated lymphoid nodules (e.g. Peyer&#8217;s patches) and finally to the lymphoid organs (e.g. lymph node, spleen).</li>

<li>Compare and contrast the structure of the lymphoid organs (i.e. spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, and tonsils)</li>

<li>Describe the circulation of blood of each lymphoid organ, citing features that they have in common and those that are dissimilar.</li>

<li>Identify the lymphoid nodule, discuss its structure and the function of the germinal center.</li>

<li>Compare and contrast the different functions of the spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus.</li>

<li>Discuss the activity of the epithelial reticular cells of the thymus.</li>

<li>Contrast the red versus white pulp of the spleen.</li>

<li>Discuss the different distributions of T and B lymphocytes in each organ.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='lymphocyte_distribution'>Lymphocyte distribution</h3>

<ul>
<li>Cells scattered throughout connective tissue</li>

<li>Solitary individual and aggregated nodules. Dr. Glomski says that the &#8220;balls&#8221; of cells are usually B-cells, with T-cells usually located in between.</li>

<li>Tonsils: aggregated nodules of lymphoid nodules in the nasopharynx</li>

<li>Lymphatics: thin-walled vessels that collect and transport intercellular fluid (called <strong>lymph</strong>), valved to promote unidirectional flow to and out of lymph nodes. Ultimately train through the thoracic duct up to the left subclavian vein.</li>

<li>Others: lymph nodes, spleen, thymus.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='lymph_nodes'>Lymph Nodes</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Function</strong>: maturation of lymphocytes, interaction of lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells, antibody production, trap and localize bacteria, tumor cells, or foreign material.</li>

<li>Lymph enters via afferent vessels into capsule sinus then into trabecular sinus then into medullary sinus, then out of lymph node.</li>

<li>Lymph node has a dense connective tissue capsule that continues as trabeculae into the medulla.</li>

<li>Stroma is made of reticular cells (fibroblasts) which make reticular fibers (made of Type III collagen).</li>

<li>There are also phagocytes and endothelial cells in lymph nodes.</li>

<li><strong>Cortex</strong>: outer layer contains follicles of <strong>B cells</strong>, primary nodules are solid masses of mature lymphocytes with macrophages and dendritic cells, secondary nodules are where the germinal center is located. The inner or deep layer of the cortex has dense collection of <strong>T-cells</strong>, which again are also found in between nodules.</li>

<li><strong>Medulla</strong>: cords of <strong>B-cells</strong>, numerous large sinuses lined by endothelial and phagocytic cells. Formation of efferent lymphatic vessels</li>

<li><strong>Germinal center</strong>: stains pale blue due to ribosomes in large immature cells (called <strong>immunoblasts</strong> or <strong>centroblasts</strong>), young cells are large but grow smaller and darker as they mature. Germinal center is surrounded by a ring or mantle of mature B cells. Depending on stimulation, germinal center can appear and disappear.</li>

<li><strong>Blood supply</strong>: vessels enter and exit at the hilus. Capillary formation is at the cortex, post-capillary venules in deep cortex. Circulating lymphocytes use selectins the &#8220;high&#8221; cuboidal-like endothelium on the post-capillary venules in order to enter lymph node.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='spleen'>Spleen</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lymph nodes filter lymph, spleen filters blood.</li>

<li><strong>Function</strong>: filter for blood, production of lymphocytes, interaction with antigen presenting cells, destruction of aged or abnormal RBCs, monocyte sequestration to become macrophages, platelet storage. <em>Fetal</em>: erythropoiesis, leukopoiesis.</li>

<li><strong>General histological features</strong>: connective tissue capsule with trabeculae, stroma with reticular cells making reticular fibers. Sounds similar to the lymph node!</li>

<li><strong>White pulp</strong>: B and T cells, occupies random distribution (i.e. not organized like a lymph node) of ~20% of the organ. Follicles contain B cells, non-nodular aggregates are T cells. <em>Periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS)</em> - zone surrounding the central artery that runs through the white pulp, contains primarily T-cells. There may be nodules!</li>

<li><strong>Marginal Zone</strong>: A narrow zone of modified red pulp adjacent to white pulp. Receives blood from local small arterioles, functions as site of lymphocytic emigration from blood and entry into white pulp and site of antigen exit from blood stream. Antigen presenting cells are here!</li>

<li><strong>Red pulp</strong>: venous sinuses and splenic cords (i.e., interstitial spaces that separate sinuses), filled with blood. Sinuses are thin, capillary-like vessels lined by widely spaced endothelium. Blood passes through &#8220;slits&#8221; to enter the sinus.</li>

<li><strong>Blood supply</strong>: vessels enter and exit at the hilus, large vessels are supported by trabeculae. Blood in splenic cords exposed to local macrophages.</li>

<li><strong>Blood flow</strong>: aorta to celiac artery to splenic a. to trabecular a. to central a. (lymphocyte surrounded) to small arteriole in red pulp to penicilli arteries to splenic cord (hungry macrophages for RBC degradation) to sinus to venule draining sinus to larger venule to trabecular vein to splenic vein to celiac vein to hepatic portal vein to liver to vena cava.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='thymus'>Thymus</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Embryology</strong>: Derived from the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouch (see: DiGeorge Syndrome / VCF), which pinch off from the pharynx and descend into the mediastinum. Stroma is of epithelial origin.</li>

<li><strong>Function</strong>: T-cell development and maturation. Provides a cytologically isolated zone away from external stimuli.</li>

<li><strong>Epithelial reticular cells</strong>: form the epithelial stroma of the thymus, responsible for imparting immunocompetency for developing T cells via factors (<em>thymosin, thymopoietin</em>). Create a &#8220;blood-thymus&#8221; barrier, isolating developing T cells into small groups.</li>

<li><strong>Cortex</strong>: the capsule continues as trabeculae forming incomplete lobules. This stains as a solid, dark mass. Undifferentiated T cells arrive from the bone marrow, enter the peripheral cortex, proliferate, and move towards the medulla. 95% of those cells, of course, undergo apoptosis to prevent autoreactivity. This process is facilitated with macrophages.</li>

<li><strong>Medulla</strong>: medullae of adjoining lobules are continuous with one another. Stains lighter due to fewer lymphocytes. <em>Thymic or Hassall&#8217;s corpuscles</em>: unique focal, concentric clumps of epithelial reticular cells, which become cornified. These are the gold standard for identification of the thymus, though their function is unclear.</li>

<li>Mature immunocompetent lymphocytes arrive from the cortex and exit the thymus via venous outflow</li>

<li><strong>Involution</strong>: Number of Hassall&#8217;s corpuscles increases with age. Involution begins at puberty, and concentration of lymphocytes diminishes and begin to be replaced with fat cells. Also, there&#8217;s a loss of the clear cortico-medullary structural dichotomy.</li>
