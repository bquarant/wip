<h3 id="lecture-notes">Lecture notes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Simple law of mass action - “What goes in must equal what goes out”: Arterial input = Venous output + Urine output.</li>
  <li>Another basic rule: <strong>Concentration * Flow = Amount</strong></li>
  <li>Approximately one fourth of cardiac output (<strong>CO = HR * SV</strong>, ~5 L/min) flows through the kidney.	</li>
  <li>Renal plasma flow (<strong>RPF</strong>) can be calculated from cardiac output (<strong>CO</strong>) if you know the hematocrit: <strong>RPF = CO * (1 - Hematocrit)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>GFR</strong> = Glomerular filtration rate = <strong>deltaP * (K<sub>p</sub> * A)/X</strong></li>
  <li>Facts about the GFR: Men have a faster rate than women; (125 vs. 110 +/- 15 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). GFR decreases 1% per year after age 40. There is diurnal variance in GFR, increasing throughout the afternoon but decreasing at night. GFR decreases with exercise, and can be affected by diets such as chronic megadosing of protein. Renal reserve is approximately half of normal GFR, symptomatology manifests below this threshold.</li>
  <li>Driving forces behind GFR: <strong>pressure</strong> (both hydrostatic and osmotic) and <strong>resistance to flow</strong> (factors: area, distance, and conductivity).</li>
  <li>Filtration fraction: <strong>RPF * FF = GFR</strong>. Normal physiological conditions, FF ~ 0.2 (20%).</li>
  <li>The main regulation of GFR is controlling hydrostatic pressure. The example we used was changing glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure by from 55 mmHg to 50 mmHg, this will drop the net filtration pressure 50% from 10 mmHg to 5mmmHg, a significant change in filtration pressure despite a relatively small change in hydrostatic pressure.</li>
  <li>Filtration across the renal corpuscle, or the glomerular filtration barrier: This barrier is responsible for filtration of plasma according to size and net charge. There are three major components
    <ul>
      <li>Fenestrated capillary endothelium (size barrier), pores are approximately 70-90 nm and exclude blood cells.  </li>
      <li>Fused basement membrane / basal lamina with heparan sulfate (negative charge barrier). Acellular but of mesangial origin. Negative charge excludes molecules greater than 8 nm, representing approximately 0.03% of plasma proteins under 10 kDa size.</li>
      <li>Epithelial layer consisting of podocyte foot processes. Pedicles also have negatively charged filtration slits, allowing particles under 3 nm to pass through.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Filtration properties and symptoms of glomerular disease: When your glomeruli start failing to filter properly, you will develop <strong>proteinuria</strong>, <strong>hematuria</strong>, decreased GFR, <strong>hypoproteinemia</strong>, and <strong>edema</strong> due to water retention to balance intra- and extracellular oncotic pressures.</li>
  <li>Filtration properties are affected by a range of mediators: Primarily pressure, but also angiotensin II, ANP, plasma protein content, plasma glucose concentration, and diet.</li>
  <li><strong>Regulation of GFR</strong>: Three major mechanisms that control GFR, major effect of all of them is on vessel resistance (change/effect is proportional to <strong>r<sup>4</sup></strong>)
    <ul>
      <li>Renal autoregulation (intrinsic system). Myogenic, stretch mediated. TGF = tubuloglomerular feedback, mediated by the juxtaglomerular apparatus</li>
      <li>Hormonal / paracrine (renin, angiotensin II, prostaglandins, ANP)</li>
      <li>Neural controls (autonomics)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
