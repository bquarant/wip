<ul>
<li><strong>Acute glomerulonephritis</strong> typically have an abrupt onset, often with well defined etiology and morphology. Macroscopic view is normal size or perhaps larger or edematous, without scarring but with petechial bleeds.</li>

<li><strong>Chronic glomerulonephritis</strong> have an insidious onset with obscure etiologies, and the morphology can be nonspecific. Macroscopic view shows smaller size (8-9cm), which reflects loss of functional nephronal mass. Scarring or fibrosis has finely scarred pattern, due to long term vascular or glomerular ischemia.</li>

<li><strong>Glomerulonephritis as a clinical syndrome</strong>: If you suspect a patient has glomerulonephritis, you have to distinguish between the nephritic syndrome or the nephrotic syndrome. Next lecture will be about nephrotic syndrome&#8230;</li>

<li><strong>Nephritic syndrome</strong>: &#8220;pro-inflammatory condition&#8221; - Urinalysis shows hematuria with RBC casts that have parallel borders formed from bleeding into the proximal tubule, more hypertensive and azotemic, decreased serum complement, but only slight proteinuria and edema. <span><br /></span></li>

<h3 id='acute_poststreptococcal_glomerulonephritis'>Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis</h3>

<ul>
<li>Condition marked by proliferation, inflammation, but little proteinuria.</li>

<li>Prototypical immune complex mediated glomerulonephritis, caused by specific serotypes of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.</li>

<li>Typical history is of a child who gets brought in after a sore throat a week or two ago, and now is listless, with dark colored urine.</li>

<li>Labs show: mild proteinuria, low serum complement, peripheral anti-Streptococcal antibody titer elevated.</li>

<li>Biopsy (though usually not performed) under light microscopy would show glomerulus that are hypercellular (i.e. endocapillary proliferation) without the typical openings normally seen in this capillary bed. Silver stain against basement membrane highlights inflammatory neutrophils.</li>

<li>Fresh frozen section done at an appropriate time during the inflammatory history can be subjected to immunofluorescence which would show a coarse, granular pattern of immunoglobulin deposition.</li>

<li>Electron microscopy would show more membranes with interdigitating cytoplasm due to hyperplastic endothelial cells with large, electron-dense subendothelial and subepithelial deposits (&#8220;big blobs of protein&#8221;), representing hundreds of thousands of antibody-antigen complexes.</li>

<li><strong>The Acute Serum Sickness Model</strong>: single large bolus of foreign protein, such as bovine serum albumin, are injected into a rabbit. Circulating antigen elicits an antibody-mediated immune response. Experiment monitors levels of antigen, levels of antibody to bovine serum albumin, renal function, and a biopsy is performed two weeks after injection. Biopsy reveals endocapillary proliferation, electron microscopy shows large, electron-dense subendothelial and subepithelial immune complex deposits. Kinetics graph shows paradoxical loss of immune complex just as maximum onset of glomerulonephritis occurs, but that trend is explained by immune complex deposition in the kidney. Note that not everyone in a nephritogenic situation will respond with glomerulonephritis; it&#8217;s not just the amount of antibody, it&#8217;s about the characteristics of the antibodies. One characteristic is size of the immune complex; antibody-excess immune complexes are larger than antigen-excess immune complexes, but equivalent ratios of antibody and antigen form complexes that are more likely to be nephritogenic. <span><br /></span> <div style='text-align:center;'>

</div> <span><br /></span></li>

<li><strong>Factors associated with immune complex localization</strong>: size and characteristics of the antibody-antigen complex, tissue Fc and C3b receptors, vascular permeability, and glomerular hemodynamics. <strong>Fc receptors</strong>: bind antibodies and have a variety of functions; pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory, pro-phagocytic. Immunogenetics behind Fc receptor: what type and where localized has significant effect on potential for pathology. <strong>Complement receptors</strong>: Complement receptor 1 (CR1) which is present only in glomerular epithelial cells seems to be decreased in glomerulonephritis, a pro-inflammatory change because CR1 normally binds C3b and C4b to prevent C4/C5 activation. <strong>Vascular permeability</strong>: administration of vasoactive amines increases damage done by deposited immune complexes. <strong>Charge</strong>: Cationic immunogens localize in the subepithelial location due to anionic glomerular basement membrane. <strong>Hemodynamics</strong>: high pressure system favors the arrest of immune complexes.</li>

<li><strong>Concanavalin A (ConA) Model</strong>: Model disease for glomerulonephritis mediated by antibodies against planted antigens. ConA is a lectin that binds glucose and mannose in the glomerulus, which gets infused directly into one renal artery thus causing unilateral binding. Anti-ConA antibody is infused systemically, which forms immune complexes in situ against a &#8220;planted antigen&#8221;. Biopsy is performed, revealing proliferative glomerulonephritis on the side of ConA infusion. This is a possible model for post-infectious glomerulonephritis!</li>

<li><strong>Clinical course of post-infectious glomerulonephritis</strong>: Most cases completely resolve and immune complex depositions are cleared with remission of disease. Very few, however, pursue a rapidly progressing course to renal failure within months. 1 to 2% pursue a slower course to renal failure as a result of a few years of chronic glomerulonephritis. Sporadic cases in adults are more likely to result in chronic renal damage.</li>

<h3 id='goodpastures_disease_antiglomerular_basement_membrane_antibodymediated_glomerulonephritis'>Goodpasture&#8217;s Disease: Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis</h3>

<ul>
<li>Another condition with proliferation and inflammation, but little proteinuria.</li>

<li>Goodpasture&#8217;s disease is defined as a syndrome of acute glomerulonephritis with pulmonary hemorrhage, caused by an autoantibody against the glomerular basement membrane, specifically against <strong>collagen IV</strong>.</li>

<li>The antibody then activates complement causing nephritis, but also reacts against the alveolar basement membrane causing pulmonary hemorrhage. Basic science: mechanism of action of antibody raise may be loss of tolerance?</li>

<li>Labs: Biopsy under light microscopy with PAS stains the basement membrane, showing <strong>cellular crescents</strong>. Immunofluoresence against fibrin would also stain the crescent, but against immunoglobulin would give a ribbon-like, continuous, linear label. Electron microscopy: antigen is continuously distributed, so there is no aggregation, thus not very informative. Lung biopsy shows hemorrhage into alveolar space, immunofluoresence microscopy of the alveoli look similar to that of the kidney.</li>

<li>Treatment: Autoantibody is typically self-limiting, but meanwhile use intensive immunosuppression and plasma exchange.</li>

<li><strong>Masugi nephritis</strong>: model for anti-GBM antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis. Inject rabbit with homogenate rat kidney plus adjuvant. Rabbit then develops antibody to kidney tissue, including an antibody to the GBM. Then, take the rabbits blood, isolate immune serum, and inject back into the rat. Biopsy histologically shows crescent glomeruli, continuous linear label on immunofluorescence. Antibody in Masugi nephritis has been found to be <strong>collagen IV</strong> or <strong>laminin</strong>.</li>

<li>Glomerular basement membrane is a lattice of collagen fibrils that have a collagenous and non-collagenous domain. Goodpasture&#8217;s disease autoantibody is against the alpha-3 subunit of the non-collagenous domain, but there are other epitopes as well. <span><br /></span> <div style='text-align:center;'>

</ul>

<h3 id='rapidly_progressive_glomerulonephritis_rpgn'>Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Translates to &#8220;crescentic glomerulonephritis,&#8221; requires rapid strong immunosuppression in order to prevent quick deescalation through fibrosis and sclerosis and wind up in irreversible, chronic renal failure.</li>

<li>Biopsy image inference can reveal multiple inciting etiologies, complement activation, recruitment of PMNs, enzyme damage to the GBM, growth factor activation, cell proliferation, tissue factor release, collagen synthesis, or glomerular sclerosis.</li>

<li><strong>Type 1 RPGN</strong>: Antibody-mediated, e.g. Goodpasture&#8217;s</li>

<li><strong>Type 2 RPGN</strong>: Immune-complex mediated, e.g. Post-infectious GN, SLE, or IgA</li>

<li><strong>Type 3 RPGN</strong>: No immune deposition, related to vasculitis and ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody)</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='iga_nephropathy'>IgA Nephropathy</h3>

<ul>
<li>Condition characterized by mixed nephritic-nephrotic syndrome.</li>

<li>Prevalence varies widely, again suggestive of variable immunogenetics, but is most common in South East Asian males with recurrent hematuria, often that is preceded by upper respiratory infections. 40% have macroscopic hematuria, urinalysis also shows mild proteinuria.</li>

<li>IgA nephropathy is diagnosed by immunofluoresence microscopy, and requires <strong>dominant IgA deposition</strong>, which are often found both on the capillary walls and in the mesangium.</li>

<li>Pathogenesis: excessive mucosal antigenic exposure or antigenic permeability or IgA response to mucosal exposure. Also possible: reduced clearance of circulating IgA complexes.</li>

<li>Problems with the mucosal hypothesis? The dominant IgA subtype that is found is IgA1, whereas IgA2 is the true mucosal subtype. So, maybe there&#8217;s a quantitative abnormality going on with the circulating IgA antibodies or perhaps increased IgA B Cells.</li>

<li><strong>Liver disease</strong>: There is increased incidence of IgA nephropathy in hepatic disease due to reduced clearance of circulating IgA.</li>

<li>New theory: Abnormalities in transferase activity leads to reduced glycosylation of O-linked glycans in the IgA1 hinge region, which may lead to increased self aggregation of circulating IgA, decreased clearance of abnormal IgA due to abnormal receptor engagement, or increased affinity for the mesangial matrix.</li>

<li>Biopsy can show pretty much any pathological finding: mesangial proliferation, endocapillary proliferation, crescents, necrosis, glomerulosclerosis (either focal or segmental).</li>

<li>Characterized as either <strong>idiopathic</strong> or <strong>secondary</strong> to hepatobiliary disease, inflammatory bowel disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, Reiter&#8217;s syndrome, rheumatic disease, or SLE.</li>

<li><strong>Henoch-Schonlein Purpura</strong> Specific category of pediatric IgA nephropathy, characterized by purpura, arthritis, abdominal colic, and nephritis which are manifestations of systemic vasculitis. Kidney disease is present in about 50% of folks with HSP.</li>
