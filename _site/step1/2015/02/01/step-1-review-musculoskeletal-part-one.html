<ul>
  <li>Reviving this platform as a way to get back in the habit of having tangible review materials that synthesize what I’ve been trying to learn and retain.</li>
  <li>First weekend of focused board review happened on 1/31 and 2/1, did about 60 questions in USMLErx.</li>
  <li>Tried to focus on musculoskeletal, but because everything’s so integrated, a lot of the questions that I missed or didn’t know had to do with knowledge or side effects / consequences which tap into other body systems.</li>
  <li>That all being said, my goal going forward to review the questions and to generate posts which list key “learning points” that were encountered during the weekend sessions.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mandibular nerve (V3)</strong>: can be injured during dental procedures. Supplies motor to the “3 M” muscles of mastication (masseter, teMporalis, and medial pterygoid).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Achondroplasia</strong>: FGFR3 defect leads to consititutive activation, endochondral ossification of the long bones fails to occur. Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Bones of the head undergo membranous ossification, so they’re unaffected. Most cases due to spontaneous mutations, however advanced paternal age is a risk factor.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Branchial arch derivatives</strong>: Arches become mesoderm and neural crest cells. To remember the order: “chew, smile, swallow stylishly, simply swallow, speak”.
    <ul>
      <li><em>First arch derivates</em>: Meckel cartilage, muscles of mastication (plus mylohyoid, ant. belly digastric, and the tensors), CN V2/V3. Defect is Treacher-Collins.</li>
      <li><em>Second arch derivates</em>: Reichert cartilage, muscles of fascial expression, CN VII. Defect: Congenital pharyngocutaneous fistula.</li>
      <li><em>Third arch derivates</em>: Stylopharyngeus. CN XI. Contributes to posterior 1/3 of tongue.</li>
      <li><em>Fourth thru sixth arch derivates</em>: Cartlage: thyroid, cricoid, arytenoid, corniculate, cuneiform. 4th arch: pharyngeal constrictor muscles, cricothyroid, levator veli palatini. Nerve: CN X, superior laryngeal. 6th arch: all intrinsic muscles of the larynx except cricothyroid.  Nerve: CN X, recurrent laryngeal. Surgical interventions on the thyroid are likely to disrupt the recurrent laryngeal nerve and cause hoarseness due to its innervation of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis</strong>: JRA is the most common cause of arthritis with rash and systemic symptoms in kids. There’s three different presentations, with a polyarthritis like adult RA, a pauciarthritis affecting the large joints primarily, and a systemic syndrome. Rheumatoid factor is anti-IgG autoantibodies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pasturella multocida</strong>: A common cause of subcutaneous infection or osteomyelitis after sustaining a dog or cat bite. Microbiology shows gram negative rods. Treat with penicillin.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Osteogenesis Imperfecta</strong>: Presents as child with multiple or easy fractures with blue sclerae. Can also present with hearing loss due to changes in the ossicles or problems with dentition. Biochemistry shows decreased amount of otherwise-normal Type-I collagen, which is normally found in the bone, skin, tendon, dentin, fascia, cornea, and late wound repair. Autosomal dominant inheritance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Allergic granulomatosis with angiitis</strong>: aka Churg-Strauss. p-ANCA-associated vasculitis, cytoplasmic antibodies against neutrophil myeloperoxidase. Often pre-existing asthma and allergic rhinitis. Signs: markedly elevated eosinophil count plus mononeuritis multiplex (deficits in multiple peripheral nerves). Can also see uveitis, conductive hearing loss, and joint pain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome</strong>: Presents with hypotonia, stretchy skin, hypermobile joints, congenital scoliosis. Most common form the “hypermobility type,” which is a defect in lysyl hydroxylase, which is required for cross-linking collagen fibrils. “Classical” EDS involves type V collagen. The most serious form is Vascular type, which takes out type III collagen or <em>reticulin</em> which is critical for blood vessels, uterus, and granulation tissue. Be aware that some EDS genotypes increase your risk for retinal detachment, retinal hemorrhage, and ocular fragility.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Paget’s Disease of the Bone</strong>: Osteitis deformans, localized disorder of bone remodeling caused by both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Blood work shows normal calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone but <em>significantly increased</em> ALP because there’s more bone being laid down. Risks include: chalkstick fractures, hearing loss, osteogenic sarcoma, high-output cardiac failure due to AV shunt formation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Streptococcus Pyogenes</strong>: A cause of honeycomb, crusted impetigo. Microbiology shows gram positive, beta-hemolytic cocci. Bacitracin sensitive, whereas S. agalactiae is not.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</strong>: entrapment of the the median nerve in the carpal tunnel between the flexor tendons and flexor retinaculum. Can occur due to repetitive stress injuries or due to an acute dislocation the lunate bone. Findings include Tinel sign, decreased sensation of the palmar side of first 3.5 digits, weakness of the thumb due to decreased innervation of opponens pollicis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Drug-induced Lupus</strong>: abrupt onset of SLE-like syndrome including fever, rash, and pericarditis with the development of anti-histone antinuclear antibodies. Drugs that can cause drug-induced lupuse include isoniazid, procainamide, hydralazine, minocycline, and penicillamine.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Ankle sprains</strong>: Most common is an inversion injury, which causes damage to the lateral collateral ligament complex, which includes the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL), calcaneofibular ligament (CNFL), and posterior talofibular ligament (PTFL). The ATFL is the most likely of the three to be damaged. If the injury is a eversion stress, the deltoid ligament is more likely to be damaged.</li>
</ul>
