			<h3 id='objectives'>Objectives</h3>

<ul>
<li>To understand the role of T-cells in disease</li>

<li>To learn how T-cell responses develop</li>

<li>To understand the molecular basis of T-cell priming / expansion and signaling</li>

<li>To review short-term and long-term T-cell function</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='tcell_function__an_overview'>T-cell Function - An Overview</h3>

<ul>
<li>T cells eliminate intracellular pathogens by either directly killing the infected cell (CD8+ cells) or by activating phagocytic activity (CD4+ &amp; CD8+ cells)</li>

<li>T cells also can help defend against extracellular pathogens by inducing antibody responses from B cells (CD4+)</li>

<li>Naive T-cells circulate through the blood to the peripheral lymphoid organs, where they meet foreign antigens as presented by the APCs</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='tcellapc_ligandreceptor_pairs'>T-cell:APC ligand-receptor pairs</h3>

<ul>
<li>Key point: multiple interactions are required to achieve full T-cell activation</li>

<li>While antigen recognition through the TCR:MHC interaction is essential, stabilizing and signaling molecules are both required in order to make things work. This is also termed the &#8220;immunological synapse&#8221;</li>

<li>Clustering and increase in affinity of integrins drives strong T-cell:APC adhesion</li>

<li>Signaling requires three co-receptors: <strong>CD4 or CD8, CD3, and the Zeta chain</strong>. These molecules have cytoplasmic ITAMs that promote signal transduction via phosphorylation.</li>

<li>Co-stimulatory molecules are also required, and serve as an important checkpoint to guarantee T-cell activation only occurs in the setting of true infection. This is mediated by PAMP:PRR interaction on the APC surface leading to expression of B7 or CD40 on the APC surface. B7 interacts with CD28 on the T-cell, and CD40 interacts with CD40L on T-cell.</li>

<li>There are also co-inhibitory molecules, e.g. <strong>CTLA-4</strong> which perform the opposite function of CD28 and shut down T-cell activation.</li>

<li>Sufficient T-cell stimulation results in changes in transcription factor expression. We need to know about the <strong>NFAT</strong> pathway, which is activated by calcineurin and leads to IL-2 and IL-2 receptor synthesis. Cyclosporine inhibits calcineurin, thus decreases NFAT and leads to immunosuppression. We also need to know about the <strong>mTOR</strong> pathway, which increases protein synthesis necessary for clonal expansion. Rapamycin inhibits mTOR.</li>

<li><em>Autocrine signaling &amp; IL-2</em>: Low affinity IL-2R is constitutively expressed, stimulation of T cell by the ABC with CD28:B7 interaction leads to increased NFAT transcription which stimulates IL-2 and IL-2R(alpha) production. IL-2R(alpha) now converts the IL-2R receptor to a high-affinity receptor, thus magnifying the strength of the IL-2 autocrine signal and driving T-cell clonal expansion. This mechanism insures that only T-cells that have been activated by the APC will be the ones that undergo clonal expansion.</li>

<li>Overview: first, signaling leads to induction of numerous transcription factors (minutes-hours), then co-stimulatory molecule and cytokine/cytokine receptor upregulation occurs (hours-days), then T-cell proliferation and effector phenotype maturation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='biological_actions_of_select_tcell_cytokines'>Biological actions of select T-cell cytokines</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>IL-2</strong>: Made by CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Drives the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of effector and regulatory T-cells.</li>

<li><strong>IL-4</strong>: Made by CD4+ Th2 and mast cells. Drives B-cell isotype switching to IgE. Leads to alternative macrophage activation for enhanced fibrosis and tissue repair.</li>

<li><strong>IL-5</strong>: Made by CD4+ Th2 and mast cells. Drives eosinophil recruitment and survival.</li>

<li><strong>IL-17</strong>: Made by CD4+ Th17 cells. Stimulates acute inflammation</li>

<li><strong>IFN-gamma</strong>: Made by CD4+ Th1, CD8+, NK cells. Activates macrophages.</li>

<li><strong>TGF-beta</strong>: Made by CD4+, other cells. Inhibits T cell activation, differentiation to regulatory T cells.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='cd4_tcell_effector_functions'>CD4+ T-cell Effector Functions</h3>

<ul>
<li>CD4+ T-cells act as a &#8220;helper&#8221; to either innate immune cells or B cells.</li>

<li><strong>CD40L</strong> on T cells interacts with CD40 on macrophage or B cell (co-stimulatory interaction), and when this occurs in conjunction with a TCR:MHCII interaction, the T-cell releases cytokines that enhance phagocytosis or isotype-switching. Remember that the CD40 is only going to be expressed by the APC in response to PAMP:PRR activation.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='cd4_tcell_subsets'>CD4+ T-cell Subsets</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Th1</strong>: Signature cytokine is IFN-gamma. Th1 cells activates macrophages and drives IgG production. Important for host defense against intracellular microbes, and plays a role in auto-immune diseases and tissue damage in chronic disease.</li>

<li><strong>Th2</strong>: Signature cytokines are IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Th2 cells activate mast cells and eosinophils and drive IgE production. Important for host defense against helminthic parasites and play a role in allergic diseases (see: Hypersensitivity)</li>

<li><strong>Th17</strong>: Signature cytokines are IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22. Th17 cells lead to neutrophilic, monocytic inflammation which is important for defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi. Roles in auto-immune and chronic inflammatory disease. Th17 deficiency leads to mucocutaneous candidiasis.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='contraction_of_effector_response_and_development_of_longterm_memory'>Contraction of Effector Response and Development of Long-term Memory</h3>

<ul>
<li>Effector response peaks at 5-7 days, followed by contraction from day 7-14.</li>

<li>Elimination of pathogen results in lack of further stimulation and return to baseline.</li>

<li>A small number (~5-10%) of T-cells survive long-term and become memory cells, which divide slowly but can be rapidly activated upon re-exposure.</li>

<li><strong>Central memory</strong>: located in lymphoid organs, undergo rapid clonal expansion upon re-exposure to antigens.</li>

<li><strong>Effector memory</strong>: located in periphery, provide rapid effector function at site of entry of microbe.</li>
