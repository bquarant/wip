			<h1>Effector Mechanisms of Cellular Immunity</h1>

			<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To understand how effector T-cells locate intracellular microbes</li>
  <li>To understand the effector functions of different helper T-cell types</li>
  <li>To understand the effector functions of cytotoxic T-cells</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="how-do-t-cells-get-to-sites-of-infection">How do T-cells get to sites of infection?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Chemokines are produced at sites of infection by innate immune cells.</li>
  <li>Endothelium exposed to microbes displays adhesion molecule ligands</li>
  <li>Effector T-cells express adhesion and chemokine receptors, thus permitting migration to sites of infection.</li>
  <li>Key point: naive and effector T-cells express different selectins and integrins.</li>
  <li>Naive T-cell receptors function to keep them in the lymph nodes. Receptor <strong>CCR7</strong> binds lymph-node chemokines CCL19 and CCL21. <strong>L-selectin</strong> and <strong>LFA-1</strong> are adhesion molecules that sequester the cells in the lymph node.</li>
  <li>Effector T-cell receptors favor migration to sites of infection. Receptor <strong>CXCR3</strong> binds chemokines produced at sites of infection, including CXCL10. <strong>E+P-selectin</strong> ligands allow rolling due to weak cell adhesion on endothelium. <strong>LFA-1</strong> and <strong>VLA-4</strong> (both binds ICAM-1) promote stable endothelial adhesion. Same concept as before: selectins promote rolling, integrins promote extravasation.</li>
  <li>S1P: small protein expressed in peripheral circulation but not in the lymph node. Once a naive T cell is activated, it starts expressing S1P receptor, which promotes leaving the lymph node along the S1P gradient.</li>
  <li>T-cell migration to sites of infection is <strong>not antigen specific</strong>, and is essentially the same as PMNs.</li>
  <li>Once T-cells get to the site of infection, only those that recognize the specific antigen remain and have effector functions, as compared with cells of the innate immune system which all will perform their effector functions. </li>
  <li>“Searching is not antigen-specific, but staying is”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="t-cell-effector-function-overview">T-Cell effector function overview</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All T cells go through a three phase process to elicit an immune response.</li>
  <li>(1) Induction: T cell expansion and differentiation in lymph nodes, allows T-cell to go from naive to effector.</li>
  <li>(2) Migration: Chemotaxis to site of infection or where effector function is needed.</li>
  <li>(3) Effect: T cell effector function, following activation by antigen and co-stimulatory molecules at site of infection.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="effector-functions-of-cd4-helper-t-lymphocytes">Effector functions of CD4+ helper T lymphocytes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Specific adaptive immune response is due to antigen recognition by helper T cells.</li>
  <li>Actual killing is a function of innate immune cells (i.e. macrophages, eosinophils, and neutrophils)</li>
  <li>Listeria experiment shows that (a) T lymphocytes adoptively transfer specific immunity, (b) serum fails to transfer specific immunity, and (c) only activated macrophages kill Listeria in vitro</li>
  <li><strong>Th1 cells</strong>: recognize microbial antigens expressed on MHCII, then express <strong>CD40L</strong> and secrete <strong>IFN-gamma</strong>. Th1 cells are critical for macrophage activation, especially when macrophages aren’t activated by the microbes themselves or when resistance to innate immune defenses has evolved. Macrophage response includes production of ROS, NO, and lysosomal enzymes, as well as cytokine secretion (TNF, IL-1, and IL-12) and increased MHC and costimulatory expression. IL-12 made by the macrophage further stimulates more Th1 differentiation and IFN-gamma production. “Bidirectional interactions” between Th1 and macrophages is very similar to NK-macrophage interaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Th2 cells</strong>: stimulate a eosinophil-predominant immune response. <strong>IL-4</strong> stimulates IgE antibody production, while <strong>IL-5</strong> activates the eosinophils. Th2 cells also dampen Th1-mediated macrophage activation. Important for immune response to parasites, e.g. helminths.</li>
  <li><strong>Th17 cells</strong>: induce production of cytokines that recruit neutrophils and monocytes to the site of infection. Important for eradication of extracellular bacteria and fungi. Th17 deficiency leads to mucocutaneous candidiasis. Excess Th17 is a feature of many autoimmune diseases (MS, RA, etc…). </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="effector-functions-of-cd8-cytotoxic-t-lymphocytes">Effector functions of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CD8+ CTLs recognize antigen via the TCR and CD8 interface with MHCI, and tightly adhere with the help of co-stimulatory molecules (LFA-1:ICAM-1) to form an immunologic synapse.</li>
  <li>Cytoxicity is mediated through granule exocytosis. <strong>Perforin</strong> forms pores in the target cell membrane while <strong>granzyme</strong> enters the cell and induces apoptosis.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="synthesized-example">Synthesized example</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Say you have a macrophage with phagocytosed microbes in vesicles and in the cytoplasm.</li>
  <li>First, CD4+ T cell will bind using antigen presented on MHCII, and secrete IFN-gamma, which will lead to increased macrophage activity by means of ROS, NO, and lysosomal species.</li>
  <li>But, this will only help kill the bugs that are in the phagolysosome, and accordingly the cytoplasmic bugs will still live. These, though, will hopefully get processed and presented on MHCI.</li>
  <li>CD8+ CTLs will then move in, synapse with TCR:MHCI plus co-stimulatory molecules, and release perforin and granzyme to kill the infected cell.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="evolution-of-mechanisms-to-evade-t-cell-mediated-host-defense">Evolution of mechanisms to evade T-cell mediated host defense</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Inhibition of phagolysosome fusion: mycobacteria able to survive within the phagosome</li>
  <li>Inhibition of antigen presentation: (1) interfere with TAP transporter (HSV), (2) inhibit proteasomal activity (CMV), (3) remove MHCI from ER</li>
  <li>Production of IL-10 to inhibit macrophage and dendritic cell activation</li>
  <li>Inhibition of effector cell activation by producing soluble cytokine receptors, “decoy receptors”</li>
</ul>
