			<h3 id='objectives'>Objectives</h3>

<ul>
<li>To understand how naive B-cells are activated and converted to effector cells.</li>

<li>To understand concepts of clonal expansion, isotype switching, and affinity maturation</li>

<li>TO distinguish between T-dependent and T-independent antibody responses</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='overview_of_humoral_immune_response'>Overview of humoral immune response</h3>

<ul>
<li>Naive B-cells have surface antibodies (IgM and IgD) which are antigen receptors that bind <strong>one antigen epitope</strong>.</li>

<li>There are millions of different B-cells with different sIgM and sIgD receptors, and they are generated in the bone marrow.</li>

<li>Antigen recognition drives clonal expansion and differentiation into antibody-secreting cells.</li>

<li>Isotype switching leads to generation of non-IgM antibodies, including IgG, IgA, and IgE, but remember that these all recognize the same antigen.</li>

<li>Affinity maturation is the process that generates high-affinity antibodies.</li>

<li>Memory B-cells persist can can be recalled by future exposure to the same antigen.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='primary_and_secondary_immune_responses'>Primary and secondary immune responses</h3>

<ul>
<li>Primary response: Naive B-cells are activated by a microbe with or without the help of T cells or other stimuli. There is a lag of about 5-10 days while clonal expansion occurs. Peak response is smaller than secondary response, and antibody isotype is usually more IgM than IgG. The antibodies are also of lower average affinity.</li>

<li>Secondary response: Repeat infection to an antigen re-awakens memory B cells, causing a relatively larger and quicker response. Antibody isotype is primarily IgG, though IgA or IgE can also occur. Antibodies made in this response are of higher average affinity due to affinity maturation.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='the_bcr_complex'>The BCR complex</h3>

<ul>
<li>B-cell receptor (BCR) is a membrane bound antibody, and it itself does not signal but requires co-receptors for signal transduction. These coreceptors are <strong>Ig(alpha), Ig(beta), and CD19</strong> and signaling is triggered by cross-linking of two or more of these receptors and propagated through the cytoplasmic ITAM domain.</li>

<li>The complement system can also enhance B-cell activation when C3d binds to CR2 (complement receptor 2).</li>

<li>Clustering of complexes is necessary to achieve effective signaling.</li>

<li>End result of BCR:co-stimulatory:antigen synapse is increased expression of transcription factors that promote B-cell proliferation and differentiation: Myc, NFAT, NF-kappaB, and AP-1.</li>

<li>Consequences / functional significance: clonal expansion (entry into cell cycle, mitosis), increased response to T-cell cytokines (by increased expression of cytokine receptors), and early primary antibody response (by low-level IgM secretion).</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='bcells_and_antigen_presentation'>B-cells and antigen presentation</h3>

<ul>
<li>B-cells are antigen presenting cells for CD4+ T-cells in the same lymphoid organ.</li>

<li>B-cells ingest bound antigen, break it down, and load it on MHCII for presentation to CD4+ T-cells.</li>

<li>Note that they don&#8217;t do killing, but they do do presentation!</li>

<li>In the lymph node, antigen-activated T- and B-cells meet at the junction of the T- and B-cell zones</li>

<li>T- and B-cells recognizing the same antigen interact through the antigen presented by the B-cell!</li>

<li>Then, some B-cells will become short-lived plasma cells and make small amounts of weak-binding antibodies.</li>

<li>Other B-cells will return to the follicle and initiate the germinal center reaction (along with some helper T&#8217;s and DC&#8217;s), where affinity maturation begins.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='overview_of_bcell_and_tcell_interaction'>Overview of B-cell and T-cell interaction</h3>

<ul>
<li>Signal 1: T-cell receptor recognizes antigen:MHCII on B-cell.</li>

<li>Signal 2: CD40L on T-cell activates CD40 on B-cell</li>

<li>Signal 3: T-cell cytokines recognized by cytokine receptors on B cell.</li>

<li>Result: B cell proliferates, differentiates, and isotype switches.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='overview_of_isotype_switching'>Overview of isotype switching</h3>

<ul>
<li>Isotype switching involves gene recombination to bring VDJ region next to Ig constant region exons. This works by &#8220;S&#8221; or switch regions, which come together and allow that segment to be spliced out and deleted. Now, all of your resulting antibodies will be of the same isotype, and you won&#8217;t be able to translate IgM any more. Also, remember that the VDJ re-arrangement happens long before antigen presentation.</li>

<li>Default (no signal): IgM. Principal function: complement activation.</li>

<li>IFN-gamma: IgG. Principal function: Fc receptor phagocyte responses, complement activation, passive neonatal immunity</li>

<li>TGF-beta: IgA. Principal function: mucosal immunity via IgA transport through epithelia</li>

<li>IL-4: IgE. Principal function: anti-helminth activity, mast cell degranulation (type 1 hypersensitivity)</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='affinity_maturation'>Affinity maturation</h3>

<ul>
<li>Affinity = strength of binding between a receptor and a ligand</li>

<li>Affinity of antibodies to an antigen increases with persistent or repeated exposure to the antigen</li>

<li>Increased affinity is caused by <strong>point mutation in V region of Ab</strong></li>

<li>Rapidly diving B cells in germinal centers may undergo &#8220;somatic hypermutation,&#8221; resulting in these point mutations.</li>

<li>If a mutated sIg on B-cell is recognized by antigen presented on follicular DC, then it is &#8220;rescued&#8221; from apoptosis.</li>

<li>B-cells compete for antigen recognition, and those with higher affinity for antigen are preferentially selected for survival, leading to high affinity antibodies!</li>

<h3 id='thymusdependent_vs_thymusindependent_antigens'>Thymus-dependent vs. Thymus-independent antigens</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Thymus-dependent antigen (Td)</strong>: typically proteins with non-identical epitopes. Presented to CD4+ T cells by MHC2 on APCs. Induce T-cell help for B-cells, leading to isotype switching, affinity maturation, and memory cell formation. These antigens are mainly handled by <strong>follicular B cells</strong> in the spleen and other lymphoid organs.</li>

<li><strong>Thymus-independent antigen (Ti)</strong>: typically polysaccharides with multiple repeating epitopes. These are not presented to T-cells, but instead stimulate B-cells directly by crosslinking sIg receptors. This leads to only little isotype switching (thus only IgM secretion) and affinity maturation, and poor memory cell development. These antigens are handled by <strong>marginal zone B cells</strong> in the lymphoid organs or by <strong>B-1 cells</strong> in the mucosa and peritoneal cavity.</li>

<li>The S. pnuemoniae vaccine is an example of a thymus-independent antigen, and because there&#8217;s little memory formation, this explains why you need to repeatedly get the vaccine. However, by introducing an adjuvant that also stimulates T-cells, we might be able to induce some memory!</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='homeostasis_in_the_humoral_immune_response'>Homeostasis in the humoral immune response</h3>

<ul>
<li>IgG:Ag (the &#8220;immune complex&#8221;) engages negative-signaling receptor Fc(gamma)RIIB on B-cells, which shuts down the B-cell receptor signaling pathway.</li>

<li>This terminates humoral immune response by means of ITIM stimulation once enough IgG has been produced.</li>
