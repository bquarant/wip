<ul>
  <li>Why do we perform kidney transplants?</li>
  <li>Immunological barriers to successful transplantation</li>
  <li>Classes, mechanisms, and effects of immunosuppressive medications</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="overview-of-kidney-transplantation">Overview of kidney transplantation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1954: first kidney transplantation</li>
  <li>2011: 10,399 DDT, 4,922 LDT</li>
  <li>The waiting list is growing: yearly growth in the discrepancy of number of kidney candidates on the waiting list. Growth of DDT and LDT not keeping up.</li>
  <li>Kidney transplantation is cost effective and leads to improved lift expectancy, when looking at competing cost for dialysis and the increased mortality in dialysis patients</li>
  <li>Current system limitations include high discard rates, access variability due to geography and biology, and mismatch in graft/patient survival.</li>
  <li>Proposed classification: estimate post-transplant survival, looking at candidate age, time on dialysis, prior organ transplantation, and diabetes status</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<!-- Slide 41-45 9:05am -->
<ol>
  <li>Using cyclosporine, graft survival jumped to 90%</li>
  <li>TCR activated, then CD3 is phosphorylated, which activates IP3.</li>
  <li>Calcium is released, binds to calcineurin and activates NFAT (nuclear factor activating T cells)</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Unfortunately, there is a side effect of the calcineurin inhibitors: renal fibrosis, caused by vasoconstriction and ACE sys</li>
  <li>Ironically, these kidneys fail from agent that allow the graft to be taken.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Slide 46 -->

<p>-Imuran (Azathioprine): antimetabolite, supprsesses ($20/d)
-Until Cellcept (mycophenolic acid) ($1000/mo.)
-Inhibit DNA replication by DNA missense 
-Lymphocytes entirely depend on de novo nucleotide synthesis, mycophenolic acid acts only on the </p>

<!-- 49 -->
<ul>
  <li>Rapamycin: blockade of the mTOR pathway. Prevents protein translation, causes immunosuppression.</li>
  <li>Used in combination with cyclosporine or alone, serum creatine is better. Does not cause renal fibrosis, but does lead to hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maintance
Tacrolimus: 7
Cellcept: 
Prednisone:</p>

<p>Sometimes, switch to cyclosporine if there’s side effects. </p>

<!-- -->
<p>Steroids good for preventing and reversing rejection
Use very low doses for long time!</p>

<ul>
  <li>CTLA-4 is a negative signal to the cell, “turns off” the immune system by better competitive binding of the costimulatory molecule B7.</li>
  <li>Solubilized CTLA-4 now being used (Belatacept)</li>
</ul>

<!-- 57 -->
<ul>
  <li>CD40 ligand: patients had thrombotic events due to platelet expression of CD40</li>
  <li>Benefit of blocking this pathway: B-cells require this signal to make antibodies. CD40-/- patients have hyper IgM syndrome, </li>
</ul>

<p>Chronic Graft Loss is 
- vascular change primarily due to antibodies against the transplanted organ
- Peri-tubular capillary staining positive for complement: antibody mediated rejection
- Tell whether its against MHC I or II of their donor…
- Hopefully costimulation blockade is now the answer.</p>

<p>Treatment of Transplant Rejection
- Biopsy to Confirm Diagnosis
- Cellular Rejection
	- Solumedrol, high dose
	- rATG.
	- MONITOR CLOSELY FOR BK VIRUS
- Humoral Rejection
	- Plasmapheresis, Anti-CD20 (anti-B), and 
	- Follow DSA and B(CD19) cell numbers
	- This is a signal that the kidney is not going to last a very long time…</p>

<p>Transplant Medicine is a Balancing Act
- Over-immunosuppression: infections, fibrosis, tumors, bone disease, cardiovascular disease
- Under-immunosuppression: rejection, sub-clinical rejection, dnDSA, fibrosis
- “There is no blood pressure cuff for immunosuppression”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Heart and liver transplants can become tolerant, kidneys cannot.</li>
</ul>
