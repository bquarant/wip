			<h3 id='overview'>Overview</h3>

<ul>
<li>Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDDs) are due to intrinsic deficits within the immune system and are typically caused by inherited or new genetic defects. These disorders contrast with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</li>

<li>Over 150 different PIDDs are currently recognized, with prevalence as high as 1:500</li>

<li>Symptoms typically include frequent, severe, unusual, and difficult-to-treat infections, auto-immune disorders (failure of self vs. non-self), and immune dysregulation (including hematopoetic malignancy).</li>

<li>Review the 10 warning signs of immunodeficiency from the ARC: recurrent and multiple infections, failure to thrive, no improvement with antibiotics, family history, etc&#8230;</li>

<li>Recent evidence says there&#8217;s often a long delay in diagnosis!</li>

<li>Deficiencies in different arms of the immune systems will have different clinical presentations!</li>

<li><strong>B-cell deficiencies</strong>: absent or reduced follicles and germinal centers and lymphoid organs, reduced serum Ig levels. Present with recurrent pyogenic bacterial infections</li>

<li><strong>T-cell deficiencies</strong>: reduced T-cell zones in lymphoid organs, defective T-cell proliferative responses to mitogens in vitro. Present with viral and other intracellular infections (pneumocystis, atypical mycobacteria, fungi)</li>

<li><strong>Innate immune deficiencies</strong>: variable, depending on what component is defective. Presentation is</li>

<li>Distribution of deficiencies; mostly antibody deficiencies, then B- and T- cell, lowest complement.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='b_cell__humoral__antibody_deficiencies'>B cell / humoral / antibody deficiencies</h3>

<ul>
<li>Present with recurrent sinopulmonary infections with encapsulated organism (S. pneumonia, Moraxella, H. influenza). Onset after 6 months of age, because infants have maternal IgG (crossed placenta) until then.</li>

<li>When quantifying serum Ig levels, need to consider age!</li>

<li>Distribution of antibody deficiencies: most often people have a specific antibody deficiency, followed by IgG subclass, followed by CVID, followed by IgA deficiency.</li>

<li><strong>X-linked Agammaglobulinemia</strong>: absence of mature B-cells. Caused by a mutation in <em>Btk</em> gene on X chromosome, arrests development of pre-B cell. Presents with severe infections from encapsulated organisms and chronic enteroviral meningitis. Blood work shows very low IgG, IgA, and IgM. Flow cytometry shows less than 2% B cells (CD19-gated) in lymphocyte population.</li>

<li><strong>Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)</strong>: B-cells present, but abnormal serum immunoglobulin levels and functional antibody levels. Susceptible to common respiratory pathogens. Not uniform disease, pattern of inheritance not identified yet.</li>

<li><strong>Hyper-IgM Syndrome</strong>: absence of the T-cell CD40L (X-linked) or B-cell CD40 (AR) prohibits CD40L:CD40 interaction, thus T cells don&#8217;t stimulate B cells to undergo antibody class switching to subtypes other than IgM. Blood work shows increased level of IgM with decreased levels of other immunoglobulins.</li>

<li><strong>IgA deficiency</strong>: often asymptomatic, no treatment available.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='laboratory_evaluation_for_antibody_deficiency'>Laboratory Evaluation for Antibody Deficiency</h3>

<ul>
<li>Quantify total IgG, IgA, and IgM levels (only useful past the newborn period given maternal IgG)</li>

<li>Test for specific antibody response to vaccines.</li>

<li>If antibody levels are very low, check whether B cells are present using flow cytometry.</li>

<li><strong>Flow cytometry</strong>: Initial run is a forward-scatter / side-scatter: sort by size (X-axis) granularity (Y-axis). Lymphocytes are small and non-granular, so they&#8217;ll be in the bottom left.</li>

<li>Next, run flow cytometry again on isolated lymphocyte compartment, scatter again by CD3 (X-axis, T-cell marker) CD19/20 (Y-axis, B-cell marker)</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='treatment_of_antibody_deficiencies'>Treatment of Antibody Deficiencies</h3>

<ul>
<li>Antibiotic therapy and prophylaxis</li>

<li>Immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IVIG): 400-600mg/kg q4w IV, 100-200mg/kg qw SC.</li>

<li>Doing a good job if they require less than 2 antibiotic courses per year.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='cellular_immunodeficiency'>Cellular immunodeficiency</h3>

<ul>
<li>Prone to mycobacteria, atypical bacteria, and salmonella.</li>

<li>IL-12 and IFN-gamma axis disruption!</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='combined_immunodeficiencies'>Combined Immunodeficiencies</h3>

<ul>
<li>Prone to the same risk as antibody deficiencies and cellular immunodeficiency: listeria, enterics, herpes, RSV, influenza, live vaccine strain, fungi, toxoplasma, cryptosporidium</li>

<li><strong>Wiscott-Aldrich Syndrome</strong>: X-linked WAS protein defect. Present with eczema, thrombocytopenia with defective platelets, recurrent infections with encapsulated organisms, and bleeding disorders. Treat with bone marrow transplant.</li>

<li><strong>DiGeorge Syndrome</strong>: Microdeletion of 22q11.2 leading to abnormal development of 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouches leading to thymus, parathyroid, heart, and facial abnormalities (micrognathia). 2/3 of patients have decreased T-cell counts, but their thymus function is generally still intact enough to be immunocompetent, these patients are diagnosed with Velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS). At Duke, thymic transplants to the thigh are being done in DiGeorge patients!</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='laboratory_evaluation_of_cellular_immunity'>Laboratory Evaluation of Cellular Immunity</h3>

<ul>
<li>Obtain absolute lymphocyte count on CBC, compare with age-specific data. Quantify T cells (CD3+) and T cell subsets (CD4+ and CD8+).</li>

<li>Rule out HIV.</li>

<li>Evaluate T cell function in response to antigens and mitogens, check proliferation and cytokine production</li>

<li>FISH for microdeletion on 22q11.2 deletion - look for missing markers!</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='treatment_of_cellular_or_combined_immunodeficiencies'>Treatment of Cellular or Combined Immunodeficiencies</h3>

<ul>
<li>Stem cell transplantation for severe CIDs.</li>

<li>DiGeorge Syndrome - get a thymic transfer at Duke</li>

<li>Enzyme replacement, gene therapy.</li>

<li>Medications: antibiotic prophylaxis, antifungals, antiviral,</li>

<li>Avoid: live viral vaccines, irradiate blood products</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='phagocyte_defects'>Phagocyte Defects</h3>

<ul>
<li>Typically present with Staphylococcus, enteric flora, pseudomonas, salmonella, nocardia, BCG, candida, and aspergillus.</li>

<li><strong>Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency 1 (LAD1)</strong>: mutation in CD18, a component of a leukocyte adhesion and migration. Neutrophils cannot migrate out of the blood vessels into areas of infection. Blood work shows leukocytosis, but can&#8217;t leave the blood stream! Present with impaired wound healing, severe periodontal disease, recurrent widespread pyogenic infections. Non-purulent omphalitis (infection of the umbilical stump) with delayed cord separation is also seen.</li>

<li><strong>Chediak-Higashi Syndrome</strong>: Autosomal-recessive disorder of lysosomal function, peripheral smear shows large lysosomes (full of content) in all cells. Present with oculocutaneous albinism, platelet dysfunction, abnormal NK and neutrophil killing, nystagmus, peripheral neuropathy. Death from infection or hemophagocytic accelerated phase.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='laboratory_evaluation_of_phagocyte_disorders'>Laboratory Evaluation of Phagocyte Disorders</h3>

<ul>
<li>Obtain absolute neutrophil count from CBC. Neutropenia: less than 1500 cells, severe: less than 500.</li>

<li>Use light microscope and stain for neutrophil granules to rule out CHS.</li>

<li>Assessment of oxidative burst using NBT (CGD positive: clear) and DHR assays (CGD positive: no curve shift) to rule out CGD.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='complement_deficiency'>Complement Deficiency</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Early component deficiency (C1-C4)</strong>: Components of classical complement. Present with recurrent pyogenic infection, auto-immune disease, and connective tissue disease.</li>

<li><strong>Late component deficiency (C5-C9)</strong>: Present with recurrent Neisseria infection</li>

<li>Test for complement deficiencies: Total hemolytic complement assay (CH50) looks at classic complement pathway, AH50 looks at functional integrity of alternate pathway. Samples are fragile though, so negative test might mean you need to re-run it!</li>
