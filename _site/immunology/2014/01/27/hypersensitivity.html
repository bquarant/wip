			<h3 id='introductory_remarks'>Introductory Remarks</h3>

<ul>
<li>This lecture was brought to us by Dr. Sands from the Department of Allergy, Immunology, and Rheumatology, and I think he did an overall job of introducing the concepts, mechanisms, and treatment of hypersensitivity reactions.</li>

<li>The biggest take-home message for me was that every practicing clinician needs to be aware of what these hypersensitivity reactions look like and how to appropriately manage anaphylaxis whether in the community, office, or hospital setting.</li>

<li>Additionally, Dr. Sands worked in multiple clinical examples for each hypersensitivity reaction, which helped anchor this new knowledge with a multitude of diseases that we&#8217;ve either seen before in lecture or will be seeing in the upcoming modules. While the tabular format of that presentation seemed onerous, I think it did a good job of underscoring the diversity of presentations from these hypersensitivity reactions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='objectives_and_overview'>Objectives and Overview</h3>

<ul>
<li>Describe the mechanisms of types I-IV hypersensitivity reactions</li>

<li>Recognize major clinical and pathological features of diseases caused by these reactions</li>

<li>Understand the principles underlying relevant treatment</li>

<li><strong>Hypersensitivity</strong> is an injurious, pathological immune reaction due to either uncontrolled response to foreign antigens or an immune response directed against the self.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='type_i_hypersensitivity__immediate'>Type I Hypersensitivity - IMMEDIATE</h3>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>
<p>Type I Hypersensitivity reactions manifest as a variety of clinical syndromes, including allergic rhinitis or sinusitis, food allergies (ranging from mild to fatal anaphylaxis), to bronchial asthma.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Pathway:</p>

<ol>
<li>First exposure to the antigen activates Th2 cells and stimulates B cell isotype switching to IgE</li>

<li>IgE is then secreted by plasma cells, and enters circulation where the Fc portion of IgE binds the high-affinity Fc(epsilon)R1 receptors on mast cells and basophils.</li>

<li>Repeat exposure to the antigen/allergen causes IgE cross-linking and subsequent degranulation of the mast cells and basophils.</li>

<li>Reactions can be either local or systemic, and the clinical syndrome is mediated by vasoactive amines and lipid mediators (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, PAF).</li>

<li>Cytokines (specifically IL-4, IL-13) are also released, which recruit lymphocytes and cause a late-phase reaction which can manifest 6-24 hours after initial allergic reaction symptoms develop.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>IgE coating of effector cells only happens after sensitization!</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Fc(epsilon)R1 receptor</strong>: alpha chain binds Fc fragment of IgE, beta chain is a transmembrane domain spanning alpha and gamma, gamma portion has cytoplasmic ITAM domain for effector activation</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The late-phase reaction is caused by cytokine release from the mast cells after exposure, and lead to leukocyte infiltration (from eosinophils, PMNs, and Th2), epithelial damage, and bronchospasm. The recruited leukocytes continue the cytokine storm cycle</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A word about the mediator molecules: look at the overlapping functionalities!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vasoactive amines</strong> (e.g. histamine): increase vascular permeability, increase small vessel vasodilation, and smooth muscle (bronchus, gut, <em>uterus</em>) contraction!</li>

<li><strong>Proteases</strong> (e.g. tryptase, which you can quantify in the blood during anaphylaxis): tissue damage, activation of matrix metalloproteases</li>

<li><strong>Arachidonic acid metabolites</strong> (e.g prostaglandins and leukotrienes): vasodilation, muscle contraction, increased vascular permeability</li>

<li><strong>IL-4, IL-13</strong>: stimulate IgE production, bronchial reactivity, airway remodeling, and mucous hypersecretion</li>

<li><strong>TNF-alpha</strong>: increase vascular permeability, drive leukocyte recruitment</li>

<li><strong>IL-5</strong>: eosinophil recruitment, activation, and survival</li>
</ul>

<p>Treatment of Type 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Anaphylaxis</strong> - Epinephrine (STAT, IM vs. IV), ABC support, antihistamines, steroids</li>

<li><strong>Bronchial asthma</strong> - corticosteroids, phosphodiesterase inhibitors (or theophylline), beta-agonists (albuterol)</li>

<li><strong>Various allergic disease</strong> - desensitization, omalizumab (humanized murine anti-IgE IgG), antihistamines, cromolyn</li>
</ul>

<p>Epinephrine - Mechanism(s) of Action:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>alpha-1 receptor</strong>: increases vasoconstriction, increases peripheral vascular resistance, decreases mucosal edema</li>

<li><strong>alpha-2 receptor</strong>: inhibits insulin and norepinephrine release</li>

<li><strong>beta-1 receptor</strong>: inotropy and chronotropy, supportive for anaphylactic shock</li>

<li><strong>beta-2 receptor</strong>: bronchodilates, vasodilates, increases glycogenolysis</li>

<li>&#8220;Epi is at the top of the food chain&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='type_ii_hypersensitivity__autoantibodies'>Type II Hypersensitivity - AUTO-ANTIBODIES</h3>
<hr />
<p>-Antibodies bind directly to tissue and then activate complement, promote opsonization and phagocytosis, or cause abnormal physiological responses without cell or tissue injury. -This represents a failure to recognize self from non-self.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rh-incompatibility</strong>: If a mother is Rh negative, but the fetus is Rh positive, when the first child is born the mother will get sensitized to Rh and thus any second Rh positive pregnancy will get attacked by anti-Rh IgGs (remember: they cross the placenta), resulting in erythroblastosis fetalis. You can prevent this with RhoGam, which will prevent maternal sensitization.</li>

<li><strong>Post-streptococcal / Rheumatic Fever</strong>: antibodies made against Group A streptococcal species begin to recognize and bind to heart muscle (question: is this the same mechanism as post-strep glomerulonephritis?)</li>

<li><strong>Auto-immune thyroiditis</strong>: antibody against the TSH receptor stimulates thyroid epithelial cells, causing thyroid hormone release without stimulating hormone presence</li>

<li><strong>Myasthenia gravis</strong>: Antibody against acetylcholine receptor prevents acetylcholine signal from being transmitted to muscle cells at the neuromuscular junction, symptoms include weakness (see later coverage in Neuro?)</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='the_allergic_synapse'>The Allergic Synapse</h3>

<ul>
<li>Mast cells are normally loaded with many types of IgE, so you&#8217;ll need a high-specificity IgE that&#8217;s heavily populated on the surface in order to trigger the full response</li>

<li>Mast cells are tissue bound, thus inhaled antigens can trigger mast cells in bronchial sub-mucosa and trigger an asthma attack</li>

<li>Basophils are blood borne, function largely unknown still!</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='why_allergies'>Why Allergies?</h3>

<ul>
<li>IgE and eosinophils normally assist in protection from pathogens, including parasites</li>

<li>Some folks are genetically predisposed to over-recognize and present antigens (allergens), resulting Th2 response</li>

<li>Th2 lymphocyte activation generates increased cytokines including <strong>IL-4</strong>, <strong>IL-13</strong>, (open switch regions producing IgE) and <strong>IL-5</strong> (eosinophil proliferation and recruitment).</li>
