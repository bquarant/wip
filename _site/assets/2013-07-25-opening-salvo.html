			<div class="post">
			<p>A while back, I stumbled across <a href='http://bvckup2.com/wip/'>bvckup&#8217;s work-in-progress blog</a>. It&#8217;s a simple idea - pictures and quick blurbs of text showing off everything from hot new features to laughable product development SNAFUs. What struck me most was being able to view the evolution of their product in time-lapse form; a quick scroll showed new features being built, tested, and refactored. The honesty of the posts was also refreshing - generously self-deprecating when things went wrong and appropriately congratulatory when things worked out. I&#8217;m sure this was designed primarily to be an internal tool, to show the team how far they&#8217;ve come and reflect about these developments but by making it open to the public, outsiders have undoubtedly learned from their mistakes and successes.</p>

<p>My goal with this project is to write posts for the days that I write code in an effort to document what I&#8217;ve been learning and what I still want to learn. There&#8217;s likely going to be some ugly code snippets here, erroneous assumptions, and probably other miscellaneously wonky stuff, so consider yourself warned. Outside of that caveat, if you see something that&#8217;s egregiously incorrect or could be done better, please do not hesitate to contact me at <a href='mailto:brian@quaran.to'>&#098;&#114;&#105;&#097;&#110;&#064;&#113;&#117;&#097;&#114;&#097;&#110;&#046;&#116;&#111;</a></p>
