<ul>
  <li>Remember cccDNA - covalent, closed circle of DNA has to be translated. Goes through P protein (polymerase) and RNA intermediate. Hepatitis B is closer to a retrovirus!</li>
  <li>DNA is translocated to the nucleus, where it is found in the cccDNA structure</li>
  <li>Pregenome RNA is translated at low efficiency to produce a 90 kDa polymerase protein P, which possesses reverse transcriptase activity.</li>
  <li>Before the completion of +−strand synthesis, core particles mature and these structures acquire envelopes by budding into the ER, where viral morphogenesis is completed.</li>
  <li>Progeny-enveloped virions are released from the cell by exocytosis or are recycled to the nucleus, where the process is repeated. </li>
  <li>Chronic hepatitis B: Most people are HBe Ag positive, small amount of DNA, ALT normal, normal liver biopsy. But, there’s a large group of HBe Ag positive, large amount of DNA, ALT elevated, and cirrhosis. Need to treat those!</li>
  <li><strong>Lamivudine</strong>: MOA - inhibits HBV DNA polymerase in hepatitis B and reverse transcriptase in HIV by chain termination. SNPs of the polymerase gene lead to resistance. Rash is major SAE but low toxicity. </li>
  <li><strong>Adefovir</strong>: Can be used for lamivudine resistant viruses. Another nucleoside agent. SAE include calcium dysregulation, renal dysfunction</li>
  <li><strong>Entecavir</strong> and <strong>Telbivudine</strong>: Guanosine and thymidine analogue, respectively. Very potent activity against at HBV with low rate of viral resistance, but no anti-HIV activity. Resistance conferred by SNPs</li>
  <li><strong>Tenofovir</strong>: first approved nucleotide agent. Activity against HIV and HBV. Highly active against many of the RT mutants generated by other treatment regimens.</li>
  <li>Patient with HIV and HBV, both are detectable in serum. Pick three new drugs, but don’t cover HBV appropriately then you will develop very angry wild type hepatitis virus…</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="agents-for-hepatitis-c">Agents for Hepatitis C</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Life cycle: “The cleavage of the polyprotein by viral and host-cell proteases yields structural viral proteins (core protein and envelope proteins E1 and E2) and nonstructural viral proteins (NS2 through NS5B), with a number of putative activities and functions.”  </li>
  <li>Goal of therapy: control viral replication. Chronic therapy is oral with or without subcutaneous medications</li>
  <li>Success is influenced by the genotype of the HCV.  Predominant forms in the USA, 1a and 1b, are less responsive to therapy. Europe has more 2 and 3, which are somewhat easier to treat.</li>
  <li>Virological responses using PEG-ylated interferon and ribavirin are either non-response, sustained viral response, or SVR to relapse.</li>
  <li>First choice therapy: PEG-ylated IFN + Ribavirin. Soon: Direct-acting agents.</li>
  <li><strong>Interferon alpha</strong>: triggers interferon-induced effector proteins on the exposed cell.  Mechanism: binds to IFN receptors, leads to dimerization and activation of Jak1 and Tyk2, which activate the STAT1 and STAT2 pathways. Hundreds of genes are up and down regulated; very non-specific response with complex interactions of many components of the immune system. No mechanism of resistance. Wide range of activity as anti- RNA- or DNA-viruses. Has to be given parenterally, either IM or <strong>Sub Q</strong>. PEG-ylation makes it once weekly dosing, improving outcomes. Adverse reactions: acute flu-like illness, thrombocytopenia, bone marrow suppression, neurological symptoms, AST/ALT increases. Response to IFN is genotype-specific, has demographic variability, and can be predicted with IL-28B polymorphism.</li>
  <li><strong>Ribavirin</strong>: Mechanism not fully defined, but not a direct acting agent. Mechanism of resistance is unclear. SAEs: bone marrow toxicity, hemolysis, aerosolized problems. Use with IFN for Hepatitis C, aerosolized for RSV, or for Lassa or Hanta.</li>
  <li><strong>Sofosbuvir</strong>: NS5B RNA polymerase inhibitor (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase). Devoid of side effects, extremely effective.</li>
  <li><strong>Telaprevir</strong>: Protease inhibitor. Oral, three times daily with high fat for absorption. Major SAE: rash, anemia. </li>
  <li><strong>Boceprevir</strong>: Protease inhibitor. 4 week lead in before starting drug, marked alteration of taste (dysgusia)</li>
  <li><strong>Simeprevir</strong>: Protease inhibitor. Once daily, but expensive. </li>
  <li><strong>Miravirsen</strong>: microRNA anti-sense against miR-122, works against entire transcript of HCV RNA.</li>
</ul>
