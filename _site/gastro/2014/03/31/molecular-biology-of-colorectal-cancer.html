<h3 id="review">Review!</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cancer is uncontrolled cell division and growth.</li>
  <li>Checkpoints ensure everything is OK before the cell moves into the next phase, M and S checkpoints.</li>
  <li>Cancer is a genetic and epigenetic disease.</li>
  <li><strong>Oncogenes</strong>: gain-of-function mutations in proto-oncogenes</li>
  <li><strong>Tumor suppressors</strong>: loss-of-function mutations or silencing. Generally need double hit in order to be effected.</li>
  <li>Cancer is a multi-hit phenomenon, but the minimum required amounts of hits is not known; could be hundreds. Today’s lecture on colorectal cancer will focus on the “AK-53” sequence: First, there is an allelic loss on 5q affecting APC, then a deletion on 12p affecting K-ras, then loss of p53 tumor-suppressor gene. Additional mutations required for metastasis.</li>
  <li>Genomic and chromosomal instability is a major feature of cancer…“destabilization of the chromosome leads to acceleration of mutation rate.”</li>
  <li><strong>Overview:</strong> Hereditary colorectal cancer sheds light on sporadic cancer. DNA-based testing may lead to sensitive, non-invasive screens for sporadic cancer.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="three-major-routes-to-colorectal-cancer">Three major routes to colorectal cancer</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The major routes: Wnt signaling (<em>genetic</em>), microsatellite instability (<em>genetic</em>), or CpG island methylation phenotype (<em>epigenetic</em>)</li>
  <li>High penetrance, single-gene inheritance occurs in about 5% of cases. (Examples: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), APC I1307K, Peutz-Jegher, Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), juveline polyposis.)</li>
  <li>Sporadic, non-germ line cell mutations that occur over the lifetime of the individual, responsible for 80%</li>
  <li>Low penetrance, multiple gene inheritance in combination with environment account for remainder 15%</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="familial-adenomatous-polyposis-fap--wnt-apc-beta-catenin">Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) &amp; Wnt-APC-Beta-catenin</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Gross appearance of resected colon lumen shows hundreds and hundreds of small polyps.</li>
  <li>Inheritance pattern: <strong>autosomal dominant</strong>, highly penetrant with 95% risk.</li>
  <li>Clinical course: early onset at 30-45 years.</li>
  <li>FAP is caused by mutation of the <strong>APC</strong> on chromosome 5. Linkage analysis in FAP families elucidated chromosome 5 breaks. The APC gene is a big gene and big protein, with 21 exons and 2845 amino acids. Most occur within exon 15 and result in protein truncation.</li>
  <li>Under normal circumstances and when no signal from Wnt, APC is phosphorylated and bound to a phosphorylated beta-catenin. Under these conditions, this leads to the degradation of beta-catenin. </li>
  <li>Now, when Wnt binds FrzB, multiple steps leads to APC being dephosphorylated, leading to beta-catenin moving to the nucleus and acting as a transcription factor for multiple growth related genes.</li>
  <li>But what if you have an <strong>APC</strong> mutation? If you have a non-functional or no protein, beta-catenin is now present at all times even in the absence of Wnt signalign, whereas before it occurred only in highly regulated times and places.</li>
  <li>Having a truncated protein, i.e. APC1309, is known as a <strong>dominant negative mutation</strong>, and thus has higher penetrance. Having a complete loss of one allele of APC actually is lower penetrance. Having one allele that works is better than having one that works and one that’s truncated.</li>
  <li>Turns out, APC has another function outside of Wnt signaling: cytokinesis. APC and beta-catenin is known to attached to the spindle microtubules, at the kinetochore, at the centrosome, and at cortical attachment sites. Bottom line: APC and beta-catenin interact with proteins needed for cytokinesis.</li>
  <li>Big problem occurs when the second hit occurs – taking out your one functional APC gene leads to major tumor progression.</li>
  <li><strong>Most sporadic colorectal cancers</strong> involve dysregulation and dysfunction of Wnt signaling pathways. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hereditary-non-polyposis-colorectal-cancer-hnpcc--microsatellite-instability">Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) &amp; Microsatellite Instability</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Inheritance pattern: <strong>Autosomal dominant</strong>. Early onset at 45-55 years. Highly penetrant at ~70%. Tumors arise primarily in the proximal colon, and microsatellite instability.</li>
  <li>E. coli fixes DNA mismatches using methylated template strands. MutL, MutS, and MutH are endonucleases that cut the strand allowing for methyl-directed mismatch repair.</li>
  <li>HNPCC is caused by mutations in genes encoding the mismatch repair proteins. Not known completely how mismatch repair works in humans yet, though.</li>
  <li>Mismatch repair deficiency results in <strong>microsatellite instability</strong> because of the highly repetitive nature of microsatellites. Microsatellite instability manifests as either expansions or contractions of the microsatellite regions.</li>
  <li>Mismatch repair deficient cells increase mutations at <strong>other genetic loci</strong>. Axin2, a protein involved with sequestration of phosphorylated APC and beta-catenin, has a microsatellite. Thus, a mismatch repair deficiency could result in a problem in the Wnt signaling cascade.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="transforming-growth-factor-beta---tgf-b-signaling-pathways">Transforming Growth Factor Beta - TGF-B signaling pathways</h3>
<ul>
  <li>TGF-B binding activates cytosolic serine/threonine kinase domain, which phosphorylates Smad2/3, which can translocate to the nucleus and effect gene expression.</li>
  <li>Uh oh! TGFBR-II gene contains a microsatellite; so in folks that have a mismatch repair deficiency has an increased likelihood of mutation and therefore increase</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="cpg-island-methylation-phenotype">CpG island methylation phenotype</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Methylation is a normal epigenetic regulatory event that controls (silences) gene expression</li>
  <li>Methylation is heritable from parent to daughter cell.</li>
  <li>Abnormal methylation found in many tumors, can contribute to cancer.</li>
  <li>CpG methylation of <strong>MLH1</strong> (mismatch repair): Active MLH1 is aberrantly methylated, which now puts the cell into mismatch repair deficiency. Now, Axin2 and TGFBR-II are possibly affected due to containing microsatellites.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="sporadic-colorectal-cancer">Sporadic Colorectal Cancer</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Environmental factors</strong>: spontaneous, chemical, UV light, radiation, viruses</li>
  <li><strong>Screening</strong>: colonoscopy, barium enema, stool testing (FOBT, DNA via PCR)</li>
  <li>Goals for screening: sensitivity, early detection, and non-invasive. </li>
  <li>Epigenetics and cancer: use methylation-specific PCR. Vimentin is used as a marker for methylation. Use bisulfite on DNA extract to convert cytosines to uracil, but 5-methylcytosine is resistant to this process. Methylated cytosine will remain <strong>C</strong> on your results, whereas if it was non-methylated it will be a <strong>U</strong>.</li>
</ul>
