<h3 id='histology_of_the_small_intestinal_epithelium'>Histology of the small intestinal epithelium</h3>

<ul>
<li>Epithelial cell migration from birth near bottom of crypt to villus tip takes 3-7 days before being shed into the lumen. Turnover of villus tip cells account for a significant amount (approximately 20%) of dietary protein.</li>

<li>Looking closely at the villus tip shows both a normal &#8220;brush border&#8221; membrane but also reveals apoptotic cells that are either sunken or protruding.</li>

<li><strong>Cell proliferation</strong>: an increase in number of cells as a result of cell growth or cell division.</li>

<li><strong>Cell differentiation</strong>: a progressive restriction of development potential and increasing specialization of function.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='distribution_of_epithelial_cell_types_in_the_small_intestine'>Distribution of epithelial cell types in the small intestine:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Bottom of crypt: high distribution of stem cells and Paneth cells.</li>

<li>Moving up: transit-amplifying cells</li>

<li>Terminally differentiated: absorptive cell vs. goblet cell vs. enteroendocrine cell.</li>

<li>Function is determined by the state of differentiation, and dramatic protein expression changes from crypt to villus. For example, the crypt has functional CFTR receptors secreting Cl- into the lumen, but it is unclear how this gene expression is triggered. At the villus, it&#8217;s also unclear how sodium-glucose cotransporter is expressed!</li>

<li><strong>Paneth cell</strong>: differentiated cell, but deep within the crypt. Contain cationic, antimicrobial cryptidins and defensins which are secreted in the lumen and act on the microflora. Paneth cells are turned over much slower, lasting about 20 days before undergoing apoptosis or being phagocytosed by their neighbors.</li>

<li><strong>Transit-amplifying zone</strong>: most rapidly proliferating cells, already committed to differentiation but undergo several divisions on their way out of the crypt before they stop dividing and differentiate terminally.</li>

<li><strong>Asymmetric Cell Division</strong>: occurs when two daughter cells of a cell division have different properties; for example, one may remain a stem cell, while the other becomes a transit-amplifying cell. Some stem cells undergo asymmetric division, others do not. TA cells generate large numbers of progeny that can then differentiate.</li>

<li>Of note: not clear at what point progeny lose stem-cell potency and become irreversibly committed to differentiation. Most stem cells divide into <strong>one</strong> new stem cell and <strong>one</strong> TA daughter cell. The TA cell then proliferates, migrates, and/or differentiates.</li>

<li><strong>LGR-5</strong> (Leucine-rich repeat-containing GPCR-5) is an orphan GPCR, expressed <strong>only in the crypt base columnar cells</strong> that are located between Paneth cells.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='the_crypt'>The Crypt</h3>

<ul>
<li>The crypt is a &#8220;stem cell niche&#8221; that nurtures stem cells. Non-stem cells in the crypt, like fibroblasts, provide a sheltering environment that sequesters the stem cells from differentiation and apoptotic stimuli.</li>

<li>Signals from the micro-environment promote stem cell population maintenance, but also safeguards against excessive production. Balance quiesence and activity.</li>
</ul>
<span><br /></span>
<h3 id='epithelium_and_mesenchymal_elements_of_the_cryptvillus_axis'>Epithelium and Mesenchymal Elements of the Crypt-Villus Axis</h3>

<ul>
<li>Basement membrane contains myofibroblasts; contain actin and myosin and can distort the shape. alpha-Smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) will stain myofibroblasts and pericytes in the intestinal lamina propria.</li>

<li>Pericytes contract around endothelial cells.</li>

<li><strong>Mesenchymal fibroblasts release Wnt as a pro-proliferation factor</strong>. Wnt is a secreted protein found in the crypt, but not the villus. Wnt is present = cell proliferation and maintenance of stem cell compartment, and thus is present in the crypt. Lack of Wnt allows Notch signaling to help determine cell lineage.</li>

<li>No Wnt? APC complex keeps B-catenin low, thus &#8220;ready&#8221; for differentiation.</li>

<li>Wnt secreted by mesenchymal cells? Inhibition of APC complex, B-catenin translocates to nucleus and activate gene transcription for cell proliferation.</li>

<li>Nuclear B-catenin stains brown, only the villus membranes stain positive whereas in the crypt nuclei are positive as well.</li>

<li>Signaling of <strong>differentiation</strong> by mesenchymal and epithelial-derived <strong>Notch</strong>: Cells that escape this fate become secretory cells: Paneth, goblet, or enteroendocrine cells. <strong>FOLLOW UP SLIDE 25-26</strong></li>

<li>Most cells differentiate towards absorptive cells, because they are activated through the Notch pathway.</li>

<li>Cells that escape Notch pathway become secretory cells, and there are relatively fewer of them. Lateral inhibition is a mutual feature.</li>

<li>That&#8217;s not the end of the story: When Notch is activated, a transcription factor called Math1 is off; however, when Notch signaling is not present, Math1 is functional, contributing to the differentiation towards a secretory cell type fate.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='graded_epithelialmesenchymal_interactions_orchestrate_signalying'>Graded Epithelial-Mesenchymal Interactions Orchestrate Signalying</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Follow up: Slide 30</strong> -BMPs: repress nuclear beta-catenin accumulation and suppress proliferation, a check against possibility of Wnt still being encountered.</li>

<li>Villus: Both BMPs from myofibroblasts and Hh suppress proliferation and cause differentiation!</li>

<li>Crypt: Wnt signaling, BMP antagonists: encourage proliferation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='what_are_the_effects_of_integrins_on_differentiation'>What are the effects of integrins on differentiation?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Specific laminin subunit binding can lead to signal transduction&#8230;</li>

<li>How is the basement membrane and mesenchyma altered in disease?</li>

<li>Does a lack of laminins affect the phenotype of a disease, or is it the phenotype of the disease state?</li>
