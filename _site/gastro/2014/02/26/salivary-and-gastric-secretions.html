			<h3 id="lecture-objectives">Lecture Objectives</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Know the effects of the autonomic nervous system on salivary secretion.</li>
  <li>Know the approximate ionic composition and osmolarity of saliva and the way in which these parameters vary with salivary flow rate.</li>
  <li>Understand the relationship between parts of the “salivon” in production of saliva.</li>
  <li>Know the functional anatomy of the stomach, the various cell types found in different regions of the stomach and their major secretory products.</li>
  <li>Know the approximate ionic composition of gastric juice and how it varies with secretory rate. For each ion, explain why concentration varies with secretory rate.</li>
  <li>Know the cellular mechanism of gastric acid secretion by parietal cells.</li>
  <li>Know the membrane receptors on parietal cells and how neural and humoral factors act on these receptors to stimulate gastric acid secretion.</li>
  <li>Know the chemical nature of gastrin and the sites in the gastrointestinal tract where it is synthesized and released.</li>
  <li>Know how secretin and other factors inhibit gastric acid secretion.</li>
  <li>Understand the concept of “potentiation” and know why blocking the action of histamine on parietal cells will dramatically reduce the secretion of gastric acid.</li>
  <li>Describe the modulation of gastric acid secretion by the enterochromafin-like cell (ECL cell).</li>
  <li>Know that somatostatin and histamine are paracrine regulators of acid secretion in the stomach.</li>
  <li>Define the major characteristics, and temporally relate the cephalic, gastric and intestinal phases of gastric secretion.</li>
  <li>Understand the relation between intrinsic factor and the absorption of vitamin B12. </li>
  <li>Know the site of secretion of intrinsic factor and the site of vitamin B12 absorption.</li>
  <li>Explain why the treatments devised by Minot and Murphy (raw liver) and Castel (infusion of normal stomach contents) were successful in preventing pernicious anemia.</li>
  <li>Recall the form in which the digestive enzyme of the stomach is elaborated and activated. </li>
  <li>Know the effects of omeprazole, atropine and cimetidine on gastric secretion.</li>
  <li>Understand the concept of the gastric mucosal barrier, how this barrier functions under normal conditions, some of the agents that can disrupt it, and the effects of this disruption.</li>
  <li>Know the relationship between helicobacter pylori and ulcers.</li>
  <li>Understand how Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and atrophic gastritis affect plasma gastrin
levels and gastric acid secretion. </li>
  <li>Know the underlying causes of GERD.</li>
</ol>
