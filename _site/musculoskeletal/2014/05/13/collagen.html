<ol>
  <li>State the three types of inherited diseases illustrated by collagen</li>
  <li>Describe the clinical features of Osteogenesis Imperfecta</li>
  <li>Explain how mutations which result in abnormal collagen chains lead to more severe clinical symptoms than synthesis defects</li>
  <li>Explain how Osteogenesis Imperfecta defects illustrate the mechanisms for autosomal dominant traits</li>
  <li>Describe the clinical features of Ehlers Danlos syndrome</li>
  <li>Explain how EDS illustrates inherited diseases due to defective protein processing</li>
  <li>Explain how defects in a processing enzyme can lead to the same clinical symptoms as an abnormal structure of the protein modified by the enzyme</li>
  <li>Explain why EDS is often autosomal recessive, but can be autosomal dominant</li>
  <li>Describe the defect in the most common types of EDS (I&amp;II) and the normal role of type V collagen</li>
  <li>State the abnormality in keloid</li>
  <li>State the role of fibrillin in elastic fiber assembly and Marfan’s disease</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="overview-of-collagen">Overview of Collagen</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Collagen, of course, is a <strong>super star</strong> and its amazing variety of structures and functions are obviously related to genetics, the cross-linking of fibrils and fibers, and carbohydrate attachments.</li>
  <li>“The University of Collagen Diseases”: What can we learn from collagen and its related diseases? Dominant traits, protein processing defects, families of related diseases with similar signs and symptoms but with variable severity.</li>
  <li><strong>Collagen Assembly</strong>: start with a single chain of collagen as a polyproline helix, need <strong>three</strong> normal chains to make a functioning collagen molecule. For Type 1 collagen, which makes up 90% of the collagen in our bones, skin, and ligaments, you need 2 x <span><code>α<sub>1</sub></code></span> and 1 x <span><code>α<sub>2</sub></code></span>. These three chains are supercoiled and stabilized with hydrogen bonding and glycine residues allowing for close interactions. The resulting triple helix is called <strong>tropocollagen fibril</strong>; procollagen is the intracellular precursor molecule which retains terminal globular domains which require cleavage. Each tropocollagen molecule overlaps 4 other tropocollagen molecules, and at the overlap there are are cross-links.</li>
  <li>Tendon and cornea fibers are merely collagen fibers woven differently; the number and specific positions of the cross-links and carbohydrates determine these structural properties.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="primary-structure-of-collagen">Primary Structure of Collagen</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The fundamental unity of collagen is three long polyproline chains, each of about 1000 amino acid length</li>
  <li>Every third position is a <span><code>Gly</code></span> residue, with high internal homology.</li>
  <li>25% of collagen 1 is <span><code>Pro</code></span> or <span><code>OH-Pro</code></span> residue which allow hydrogen bonding through a water bridge, also frequent is <span><code>Ala</code></span></li>
  <li>Lysine (<span><code>Lys</code></span>) residues are also important, they can be hydroxylated and used for cross-links or carbohydrate attachment sites; <span><code>Lys</code></span> residues can also be oxidized to an aldehyde where they can function in cross-linking.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="collagen-processing">Collagen Processing</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Intracellular processing:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Some <span><code>Pro</code></span> residues are converted to <span><code>OH-Pro</code></span> via <strong>protocollagen hydroxylase</strong> using cofactors Fe<sup>2+</sup> and ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Nutritional deficiency of vitamin C leads manifests as scurvy.</li>
      <li>Procollagen is formed inside the cell and then secreted; but first, in the RER a signal peptide must be cleaved by a specific <strong>peptidase</strong></li>
      <li>Some <span><code>Lys</code></span> residues also are hydroxylated but by <strong>lysine hydroxylase</strong> which also uses ascorbic acid as a cofactor. Once hydroxylated, transferases in the RER and Golgi add function-specific carbohydrate residues. Deficiencies in lysine hydroxylase manifest as EDS Type VI (ocular).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Extracellular processing:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Globular domains from the ends of the procollagen molecule are cleaved by <strong>N,C-procollagen proteinases</strong> into tropocollagen</li>
      <li>Lysine residues are oxidized into lysal aldehyde by <strong>lysyl oxidase</strong> using Cu<sup>2+</sup> as a cofactor for cross-linking</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="collagen-processing-clinically-significant-facts">Collagen Processing: Clinically Significant Facts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Processing is co-translational</li>
  <li>Rate is critical: The gene for <span><code>α<sub>1</sub></code></span> chains is transcribed twice as fast as the gene for <span><code>α<sub>2</sub></code></span>; resulting in the 2:1 ratio needed for Type I collagen.</li>
  <li>Procollagen folding beings <strong>after</strong> the complete chains are synthesized, and is regulated by chaperone proteins.</li>
  <li>Folding of procollagen begins at the C-terminal globular domain and proceeds toward the N  terminal; the triple helix forms like a closing zipper, so a “single broken tooth of the zipper” disrupts the triple helix N-terminal to the site of the problem. Thus, mutations towards closer to the C-terminal half of the protein are more serious than those towards the N-terminal.</li>
  <li>In fact, only mutations at <span><code>Gly</code></span> residues in the first 20% of the N-terminal sequence are non-fatal</li>
  <li>Cross-linking between tropocollagen molecules only happens outside the cell, and only when the globular domains have been digested away.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="inherited-diseases-of-collagen">Inherited Diseases of Collagen</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Almost all inherited diseases of collagen are <strong>autosomal</strong>, but there is one gene for collagen on the X chromosome, which leads to Alport syndrome (see: renal module, hereditary nephritis with hearing loss and ocular symptoms, due to Type IV collagen defect).</li>
  <li>Disease severity: can be fatal (prenatal, perinatally, or in the adult), moderate to severe, or mild.</li>
  <li>Two major categories: <strong>Osteogenesis Imperfecta</strong> - brittle bone disease, <strong>Ehlers Danlos syndromes</strong>: either affecting the skin (fragility, hyperextensibility) or joints (hypermobility).</li>
  <li>Pick up at 33:35</li>
</ul>
