<ul>
<li>Paradox: high remodeling potential, but growth plate injury with permanent growth arrest is possible</li>

<li>Salter-Harris classifications of growth plate injury has been developed.</li>

<li>Salter I: fracture goes just across growth plate. Typically do not cause growth problems, because it goes across the zone of provisional calcification and not through resting reserve zone. &#8220;Typically heal with no problem or long-term sequelae&#8221;</li>

<li>Salter II: goes across growth plate and then out through the metaphysis, again not going through the resting reserve zone and typically heals well without consequences.</li>

<li>Salter III: goes through epiphysis, and then into the growth plate. Crosses resting reserve zone, can cause permanent growth problems.</li>

<li>Salter IV: goes across both epiphysis and metaphysis, can also result in permanent growth problem.</li>

<li>Salter V: Crush injury, just across the growth plate, usually noted retrospectively!?</li>

<h3 id='scoliosis'>Scoliosis</h3>

<ul>
<li>Definition: lateral curvature of the spine more than 10 degrees.</li>

<li>Test: Adams Forward Bend Test - evaluate for equal shoulders</li>

<li>Classification: location (C/T/L/S), etiology, age (infantile, juvenile, adolescent).</li>

<li>Etiology: idiopathic, congenital, neuromuscular, connective tissue related. Nothing to do with posture!</li>

<li>Things that might look like scoliosis but is not: basic postural problems, leg length discrepancy, or Sprengel&#8217;s deformity (un-descended scapula)</li>

<li>Indications for MRI: pain, neurological symptoms, atypical curve</li>

<li>Treat with observation if curve less than 25 degrees, brace if curve greater than 30 and still growing, surgery if curve is greater than 50.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='childhood_hip_conditions'>Childhood Hip Conditions</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH)</strong>: a spectrum of hip instability problems. Leads to early arthritis in teens or 20s. Usually have normal gait and can be clinically silent..</li>

<li>DDH Risk Factors: <strong>breech position</strong>, female sex, first born child, family history of ligamentous laxity, ethnicity</li>

<li>Diagnosis: infants - abnormal nursery exam + breech birth is concerning. Toddlers might show short leg, limp, toe walking. If bilateral, they might waddle. Typically not much in the ways of pain or irritability.</li>

<li>Treatment of DDH ideally involves early diagnosis and bracing with a <strong>Pavlic harness</strong>.</li>

<li>Ortolani maneuver: reduces a dislocated hip, abduct and lift the greater trochanter; Barlow maneuver: dislocates a reduced hip, adduct the leg to the midline and push gently down and lateral.</li>

<li>Imaging: under 4 months, use ultrasound due to incomplete ossification; older, xray is appropriate.</li>

<li><strong>Slipped capital femoral epiphysis</strong>: concern for presentations with hip and leg pain in obese children.</li>
