			<h3 id="bone-overview">Bone Overview</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Bone functions: protective, storage of calcium (99%) and phosphate, levers to which skeletal muscle attach, framework for body support.</li>
  <li>206 different bones with variety of shapes and functions, but with common characteristics: outer shell or envelop or cortex of dense, compact bone. </li>
  <li>Interior of bone is cancellous or trabeculae, which is just as hard and mineralized but with a different arrangment.</li>
  <li>Outer layer is germative layer, contains vessels and stem cells.</li>
  <li>Long bones: midshaft - diaphysis, distal ends called epiphysis. In between diaphysis and epiphysis is called metaphysis.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="bone-composition">Bone Composition</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cells: 10% of bone weight. Arise from mesenchymal stem cells. Osteoprogenitor cells give rise to osteoblasts, which can mature into the osteocyte. Osteoblasts secrete osteoid component (see below) and facilitate mineralization. Osteocytes monitor and help out with normal function. Osteoclasts, arise from monocyte/macrophage lineage in bone marrow, their function is to break bone down.</li>
  <li>Extracellular matrix: soft organic component (proteoglycans and type 1 collagen) 30% of bone weight, inorganic (calcium and phosphate in hydroxyapatite crystals) 60% of bone weight.</li>
  <li>Mesenchymal pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into chondroblasst or osteoblast lineage.</li>
  <li><strong>Osteoblast products</strong>: Major component of osteoid is Type 1 Collagen (90%). Collagenase “cleans off bone surface” before osteoclast action. Alkaline phosphatase, bone specific type not to be confused with AP of liver origin, increased in the setting of Paget’s, hyperparathyroidism, or primary/secondary oncological process. </li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="normal-microscopic-structure-of-bone">Normal microscopic structure of bone.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Top surface: periosteum, stem cells –&gt; osteoid progenitor –&gt; single file line of osteoblasts. Secrete osteoid from basal surface. Ultrastructure shows lots of RER which makes sense due to secretory functions.</li>
  <li>Some osteoblasts get trapped in the bone, at which point they become osteocytes.</li>
  <li>Sit in a lacunar space, similar to chondrocytes.</li>
  <li>Cytoplasmic extensions called canaliculi, contact other osteocytes this way in order to sense local environment and feedback to osteoblasts. </li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="bone-mineralization">Bone mineralization</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Takes about 2 weeks for new layer of osteoid to become mineralized.</li>
  <li>First, secretory vesicles of osteoid in the osteoblast are secreted into the osteoid layer. AP on their surface increases the calcium concentration in the osteoid, which facilitates crystallization. Crystals then become to form on the type 1 collagen.</li>
  <li>Histological sample: need “un-decalcified” sample to see the osteoid seams. Radiolabeled technetium will also deposit along the mineralization front; can be used as a measure of increased bone formation.  Aluminum will also deposit here, problem for dialysis patients if there is aluminum in the dialysate, making their bones weak and soft. Tetracycline antibiotics will also deposit here; two bright yellowish-green lines correspond to tetracycline fluorescence and rate of bone formation can be calculated and compared with normal values for patients age and gender.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="osteoblast-signaling">Osteoblast signaling</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mechanical factors</li>
  <li>GM-CSF stimulates osteoclast recruitment. </li>
  <li>Done so that bone can respond to stress and load, and release calcium into the blood for homeostasis</li>
  <li>Review slide 12!</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="osteoclast-function">Osteoclast function</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Multinucleated cells that sit in depression called “Howship lacunae”</li>
  <li>Central area has microenvironment of low pH and lysosomal enzymes, which are good at releasing the minerals and processing the organic components of osteoid, respectively.</li>
  <li>Cancellous bone has lots of open spaces, good for this function</li>
  <li>Cutting cones: groups of osteoclasts dig a tunnel through the cortical bone, carrying with it blood vessels and osteoblats, over and over new layers of bone are formed. See slide 14 for a visual.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><br /></span></p>

<h3 id="bone-formation">Bone formation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Embryological development: two paths - membranous or endochondral. Bone forms in both ways by replacement of a pre-existing connective tissue.</li>
  <li>Membranous: bone develops directly from mesenchymal stem cells in the periosteum. Gives rise to compact cortical long bones and flat bones, composing the majority of the skeleton. Newly formed bone is known as primary spongiosa, which is not very strong yet. Evidenced with polarized microscopy, collagen fibers will be in all directions and known as “woven” bone. Then, this bone will be remodeled into straighter parallel stacks of bone, known as “lamellar” bone. Haversian system: bone becomes remodeled into groups of concentric circles, each set called an <strong>osteon</strong>, with a vessel in the center and with canaliculi communicating with them.  </li>
  <li>Endochondral: first step is pre-formed in hyaline type collagen, which then are gradually replacement with mineralized bone. Gives rise to trabecular or cancellous bone. Fragments of calcium cause death of chondrocytes, but that allows osteocytes to move in.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="review-of-endochondral-ossification">Review of endochondral ossification</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Covering germinative membrane gets signal, tells it to become periosteum. </li>
  <li>Membranous ossification then begins at the outside of the bone</li>
  <li>Blood vessels </li>
  <li>Cartilage matrix </li>
  <li>Cells at the </li>
