### Overview of Hematopoiesis
- CD34 is an immature stem marker, gets lost during development

<span><br></span>
### Hematologic malignancies
- Hematologic malignancies = clonal disease: an unknown complex sequence of events in which a **mutated stem cell** forms a clone that has the capability of survival with or without differentiation or maturation, and respond poorly to normal feedback stimuli.
- Defining the clone: the clone is composed of genotypically identical cells that ay or may not have ability to mature. They harbor identical genetic abnormalities, but may have variable cytomorphological or immunophenotypic features.

### Tools in diagnostic work-up of hematologic malignancies
- Morphology: cytomorphology, histomorphology
- Immunophenotyping: immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry
- Conventional and molecular cytogenetics: karyotyping, fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH)
- Molecular diagnostics: polymerase chain reaction, DNA sequencing, gene expression and genomic profiling microarrays
- Chromosome mutations: rearrangement of the genetic material, resulting in structural chromosomal changes or fusion/translocated genes resulting in functional or biological pathway changes
- **Follicular lymphoma**: t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation. IGH immunoglobulin gene enhancer is translocated and stimulates expression of Bcl-2, an apoptosis inhibitor, leading to cell accumulation.
- **Burkitt lymphoma**: t(8;14)(q24;q32). IGH stimulates expression of c-myc, which induces proliferation even in the absence of growth factors
- **Chronic myelogenous leukemia**: t(9;22)(q34;q11.2). BCR-ABL1 fusion protein cause to enhanced tyrosine kinase activity, leading to increased proliferation and reduced adherence to bone marrow stromal cells and decreased cell death. Gleevec (imatinib) is available for as the first targeted therapy oral drug.
