### Lecture Objectives
1. Know the effects of the autonomic nervous system on salivary secretion.
2. Know the approximate ionic composition and osmolarity of saliva and the way in which these parameters vary with salivary flow rate.
3. Understand the relationship between parts of the "salivon" in production of saliva.
4. Know the functional anatomy of the stomach, the various cell types found in different regions of the stomach and their major secretory products.
5. Know the approximate ionic composition of gastric juice and how it varies with secretory rate. For each ion, explain why concentration varies with secretory rate.
6. Know the cellular mechanism of gastric acid secretion by parietal cells.
7. Know the membrane receptors on parietal cells and how neural and humoral factors act on these receptors to stimulate gastric acid secretion.
8. Know the chemical nature of gastrin and the sites in the gastrointestinal tract where it is synthesized and released.
9. Know how secretin and other factors inhibit gastric acid secretion.
10. Understand the concept of “potentiation” and know why blocking the action of histamine on parietal cells will dramatically reduce the secretion of gastric acid.
11. Describe the modulation of gastric acid secretion by the enterochromafin-like cell (ECL cell).
12. Know that somatostatin and histamine are paracrine regulators of acid secretion in the stomach.
13. Define the major characteristics, and temporally relate the cephalic, gastric and intestinal phases of gastric secretion.
14. Understand the relation between intrinsic factor and the absorption of vitamin B12. 
15. Know the site of secretion of intrinsic factor and the site of vitamin B12 absorption.
16. Explain why the treatments devised by Minot and Murphy (raw liver) and Castel (infusion of normal stomach contents) were successful in preventing pernicious anemia.
17. Recall the form in which the digestive enzyme of the stomach is elaborated and activated. 
18. Know the effects of omeprazole, atropine and cimetidine on gastric secretion.
19. Understand the concept of the gastric mucosal barrier, how this barrier functions under normal conditions, some of the agents that can disrupt it, and the effects of this disruption.
20. Know the relationship between helicobacter pylori and ulcers.
21. Understand how Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and atrophic gastritis affect plasma gastrin
levels and gastric acid secretion. 
22. Know the underlying causes of GERD.
