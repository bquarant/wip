### TODO
- Complete lecture objectives

<span><br></span>

### Learning Objectives
- Recap immunology and reconsider in the light of neoplasm

<span><br></span>

### Lymphoid Malignancies - Presentation
- Lymphadenopathy: localized or generalized, peripheral vs. central
- Nodal or extranodal involvement
- Peripheral blood involvement
- Systemic symptoms: fever, weight loss, malaise, anorexia
- Bone pain
- Symptoms secondary to mass effect

### Lymphoid Malignancies - Lymphoma vs. Lymphoid Leukemia
- **Leukemia**: usually starts in the bone marrow and may spread to other places.
- **Lymphoid leukemia**: when origin and presentation is primarily in the bone marrow and peripheral blood
- **Lymphoma**: start in the lymph nodes and then spread to the bone marrow, "confined" process
- Sometimes, abnormal lymphocytes are found in both the bone marrow and lymph nodes, making it hard to tell whether the cancer is a leukemia or lymphoma, but what matters most is what type of abnormal lymphocytes are present.

### The High Grade Lymphoid Malignancies - Lymphoblastic neoplasms
- **Presentation**: abrupt, stormy onset within days to weeks of first symptoms. May have symptoms related to depression of bone marrow function or mass effect from neoplastic infiltration (bone pain, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly.). CNS manifestations due to meningeal infiltration.
- Due to immature, primitive cells, rapid time course, high mitotic activity.
- May present either as leukemia (acute lymphocytic/lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL) or lymphoma (lymphoblastic lymphoma)
- ALL is the most common cancer in children (under 15), B-ALL most common, T-ALL rare, seen in adolescent males with thymic masses.
- **T-lymphoblastic Leukemia**: T-lineage primitive neoplasm derived from thymus-based T-cell progenitors, relatively rare, more common in adolescent males. Look for anterior mediastinum masses, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly.
- Bone marrow is typically **hypercellular**, packed with lymphoblasts showing open delicate chromatin structure and small nucleoli. Cell markers include CD34, TdT (95%), and early T- or B- markers. 90% ALL have numerical or structural chromosomal changes, which determine chemotherapy sensitivity and have prognostic significance.
- Classification: use immunologic techniques (determine B vs. T) and cytogenetic techniques (find prognosticators).
- Critical to distinguish between ALL and AML, given treatment difference!
- **Prognosis**: 80% of children, 40% of adults are cured at 10 years. Worse prognosis with age (under two or as adult), MLL gene translocation, blast count greater than 100, or particular cytogenetic rearrangements like t(9;22)
