### Things to follow up on:
- Add notes from the introductory material?
- Link to getting Little Robbins on UB HSL? Or buying it?
- Slide regarding the molecular structure of the proteasome
- Make better notes on autophagia
- Figure out how to make a markdown table for the necrosis vs. apoptosis comparison table...

###  Protein Misfolding - Desmin Storage Disease
- Misfolded **desmin** protein is formed.
- Desmin is handled by chaperone protein, **alpha-beta-crystalline**, which tries to refold it.
- Despite this, the misfolded desmin protein persists
- Alpha-beta-crystalline then presents desmin for ubiquitination
- Desmin then enters the ubiquitin-proteasome system, but despite this the system fails and desmin accumulates.
- The ubiquitin system, briefly: **E1/E2** activate the ubiquitin system, **E3** is ubiquitin ligase that adds the ubiquitin to the protein substrate.
- Multiple rounds of ubiquitination go on, and after about a half a dozen rounds, protein substrate is introduced to the proteasome.
- Overview of the proteasome: it's a hollow center with two 19S caps and a 20S core that's full of enzymes. The overall function is to chop the ubiquitinated protein substrate into smaller peptides.

###  Autophagia
- "The process of eating tiny little bits of one's self." 
- There's lots of triggers or reasons why this might be started: cell damage, apoptosis, protein aggregate formation, calorie restriction or starvation, infection (xenophagy), or malignancy
- Simplified pathway to autophagia: (1) autophagosome formation, the unwanted stuff is surrounded by a membrane, example pathway we were taught starts with **UVRAG** leading to a **Beclin 1 complex** which then activates **PI3P (phosphotidylinositol-3-phosphate)** pathway leading to autophagosome formation and nucleation. (2) Then, a complex of proteins, **ATG5-ATG12-ATG16**, combines with the autophagosome, leading to elongation and maturation. Note that **Bcl-2** (see below) inhibits the Beclin 1 complex formation and thus inhibits autophagy

###  Cell Death
- Irreversible process in living tissue, occurs via necrosis and apoptosis
- Fixation is a form of cell death, but the fixative agent makes cells look normal under the microscope
- Autolysis is also different; cells look poorly preserved because they've been broken down by their own enzymes. Autolysis interferes with proper interpretation, avoid it!
- **Necrosis**: always pathologic. Types include: coagulation, liquifaction, caseous, enzymatic (fat necrosis), infarction, or ulceration. Eosinophilic cells found, along with PMNs.
- **Apoptosis**: physiologic or pathologic
- **Autophagy**: physiologic or pathologic
- Causes of cell death could be anything, really: physiologic (aging, hormonal), vascular (ischemia, infarction), infection, immune-mediated, toxic, metabolic, genetic (developmental, metabolic), nutritional, neoplastic
- **Coagulation necrosis**: proteins are denatured, and cytoplasm is eosinophilic. "Red is dead." Cell shape is retained, and tombstoned. Nucleus is dark, then fragments (**karyorrhexis**) then disappears (**karyolysis**).
- **Liquefaction necrosis**: turns liquidy, see brain infarction
- **Caseous necrosis**: turns white and cheese-like, see pulmonary tuberculosis
- **Enzymatic (fat) necrosis**: occurs mainly in the pancreas as enzymes leak and destroy tissue. White-yellow appearing.
- **Ulceration**: ulcer is a type of acute necrosis, see GI lectures for more...
- Enzymes from necrotic cells are detectable in the blood because they're able to leak out! "Cellular enzymes rise in serum after necrosis."

###  Apoptosis
- "Falling off". Orchestrated, active cell death.
- Some of the various proteins involved in apoptosis:
- **Caspase**: contains cysteine, cleaves aspartase. Big players are Caspase 8, 9, and 3, the end result is activation of endonucleases to cleave nuclear DNA.
- **Fas or CD95**: destiny or fate, member of the TNF receptor family
- **FLIP**: FLICE inhibitor protein.
- **Apaf**: apoptosis activating factor
- **Bcl**: "B-cell lymphoma" - a family of anti-apoptotic proteins
- **Bax**: Bcl-associated X protein: pro-apoptic effectors
- Overview of Apoptosis:
- Path 1: Fas-Receptor (CD95) pathway: CD95 binds with FAS ligans, like TNF. This activates the cytoplasmic **"death domain"**, which activates **caspase-8**, which activates **caspase-3** and then endonuclease activity.
- Path 2: Mitochondrial route: happens due to poor homeostatic control of **Bcl-2**, which is usually maintained by external signaling (e.g. estrogen in the menstrual cycle) binding to cell survival factor receptors, and leading to maintenance of Bcl-2 expression. The mitochondria will then leak **cytochrome C**, activating **apaf-1** then **caspase-9**, which turns on **capase-3** and then endonuclease activity.
- Path 3: Free radicals, ischemia, chemotherapy: leads to DNA damage, which increases **TP53** an intermediate to **BAX**, a proapoptotic factor in the Bcl-2 (hence mitochondrial) pathway. 
- **Microscopic features**: Peripheral condensation of chromatin, pyknosis (darkening and shrinking of the nucleus), nuclear fragmentation, condensed, eosinophilic cytoplasm, apoptotic body formation. Sequestration of the apoptotic cell by phagocytes. Despite these, often difficult to tell between a necrotic cell and an apoptotic cell using light microscopy!
