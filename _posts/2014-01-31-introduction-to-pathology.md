### Things to follow up on:
- Figure out how to make a markdown table for the necrosis vs. apoptosis comparison table...

<span><br></span>

### Objectives
- Students should be familiar with the following mechanisms:
- *Necrosis, apoptosis, cell inclusions, ischemia, infarction, autophagia, and enzyme concentration change during necrosis*

<span><br></span>

### Basic Terminology
- **Pathogenesis** - mechanism of disease, stepwise progression from cause to disease
- **Etiology** - specific cause of a disease
- **Pathogenic** - able to cause disease
- **Pathogen** - agent causing disease
- **Pathologic** - abnormal
- **Pathognomonic** - finding which is unique to a disease
- **Pathophysiology** - how pathologic findings explain the clinical disease
- **Lesion** - a gross or microscopic abnormality
- **Ischemia** - reduced blood flow, may be reversible.
- **Infarction** - irreversible necrosis, commonly due to occluded artery, involving a larger area and all cell types there
- **Autopsy** - "to see for one's self," an examination of the entire body performed after death
- **Biopsy** - performed on a tissue sample just removed from a living patient

<span><br></span>

### Questions you should ask about any lesion or abnormality
 1. What is wrong?
 2. Why did it happen?
 3. What will occur next?
 4. What can be done?

### Tips regarding inspection
- Gross inspection: unaided eye, look at size and color, compare with normal.
- Microscopic inspection: look for signs of reversible injury vs. irreversible injury (cell death)
- **Size**: Too large? Think edema, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, bleeding, or tumor. Too small? Think scar tissue or atrophy.
- **White**: scar, calcified tissue, loss of normal pigment, or caseous necrosis
- **Red**: blood, hemorrhage, myoglobin
- **Green**: bile
- **Yellow**: purulent exudate
- **Blue**: deoxygenated blood, cyanosis
- **Black**: gangrene

### Reversible injury
- **Atrophy**: may apply to cells or organs, usually due to decreased protein synthesis or increase protein breakdown. Leads to reduced function and may be pathologic or physiologic. Causes include aging, disuse, starvation, endocrine, or vascular.
- **Hypertrophy**: may apply to cells or organs, may be physiologic or pathologic. Causes include exercise or hypertension (leading to left ventricular hypertrophy). Mechanism involves multiple receptors which promote increased expression of contractile proteins.
- **Hyperplasia**: excess number of cells, leading to tissue or organ enlargement. May be physiologic or pathologic. Causes: reaction to injury, endocrinological (e.g. pathologic thickening of the cervical epithelium in chronic cervicitis)
- **Metaplasia**: transformation from one cell type to another. Causes: usually a pathologic process, often times a protective reaction in response to an irritant (e.g. esophageal metaplasia leading to glandular genesis in GERD).
- **Swelling**: intracellular edema vs. increased vascular permeability. Numerous causes, basic reason is generally a more permeable cell membrane.
- **Lipid and carbohydrate accumulations**: cytoplasm can accumulate many different substances (fat, carbohydrates, iron, hemosiderin). Example: fatty liver in chronic alcoholics.
- **Inclusions**: accumulations of virus or proteins. Causes: misfolding of a normal protein or accumulation of an abnormal protein. See as eosinophilic, glassy, opaque, and homogenous bodies on light microscopy. Example: Mallory bodies in hepatocytes of alcoholics, composed of cytokeratin. They look like solid red smears within the cell. These are pathognomonic for alcoholic liver disease. The fate of inclusions is usually **ubiquination or autophagia**

###  Protein Misfolding - Desmin Storage Disease
- Misfolded **desmin** protein is formed.
- The cell tries to handle this misfolded desmin using the chaperone protein, **alpha-beta-crystalline**, which tries to refold it.
- Despite this, the misfolded desmin protein persists
- Alpha-beta-crystalline then presents desmin for ubiquitination
- Desmin then enters the ubiquitin-proteasome system, but despite this the system fails and desmin accumulates.
- The ubiquitin system's normal functioning, briefly: **E1/E2** activate the ubiquitin system, **E3** is ubiquitin ligase that adds the ubiquitin to the protein substrate. Multiple rounds of ubiquitination go on, and after about a half a dozen rounds, protein substrate is introduced to the proteasome.
- Overview of the proteasome: it's a hollow center with two 19S caps and a 20S core that's full of enzymes. The overall function is to chop the ubiquitinated protein substrate into smaller peptides.

###  Autophagia
- "The process of eating tiny little bits of one's self." 
- There's lots of triggers or reasons why this might be started: cell damage, apoptosis, protein aggregate formation, calorie restriction or starvation, infection (xenophagy), or malignancy
- Molecular mechanisms in autophagy: (1) autophagosome formation, the unwanted stuff is surrounded by a membrane, example pathway we were taught starts with **UVRAG** leading to a **Beclin 1 complex** which then activates **PI3P (phosphotidylinositol-3-phosphate)** pathway leading to autophagosome formation and nucleation. (2) Then, a complex of proteins, **ATG5-ATG12-ATG16**, combines with the autophagosome, leading to elongation and maturation. Note that **Bcl-2** (see below) inhibits the Beclin 1 complex formation and thus inhibits autophagy (and thus promotes cell proliferation, but more on this later...). 
- A simplified view: There is debris in the cell, which is surrounded by a membrane and then fuses with a lysosome. The debris may be degraded or removed. Autophagy can trigger **cell death**, but the mechanism is complex and somewhat unknown.

###  Cell Death
- Irreversible process in living tissue, occurs via necrosis and apoptosis
- Fixation is a form of cell death, but the fixative agent makes cells look normal under the microscope
- Autolysis is also different; cells look poorly preserved because they've been broken down by their own enzymes. Autolysis interferes with proper interpretation, avoid it!
- **Necrosis**: always pathologic. Types include: coagulation, liquifaction, caseous, enzymatic (fat necrosis), infarction, or ulceration. Eosinophilic cells found, along with PMNs.
- **Apoptosis**: physiologic or pathologic
- **Autophagy**: physiologic or pathologic
- Causes of cell death could be anything, really: physiologic (aging, hormonal), vascular (ischemia, infarction), infection, immune-mediated, toxic, metabolic, genetic (developmental, metabolic), nutritional, neoplastic
- **Coagulation necrosis**: proteins are denatured, and cytoplasm is eosinophilic. "Red is dead." Cell shape is retained, and tombstoned. Nucleus is dark, then fragments (**karyorrhexis**) then disappears (**karyolysis**).
- **Liquefaction necrosis**: turns liquidy, see brain infarction
- **Caseous necrosis**: turns white and cheese-like, see pulmonary tuberculosis
- **Enzymatic (fat) necrosis**: occurs mainly in the pancreas as enzymes leak and destroy tissue. White-yellow appearing.
- **Ulceration**: ulcer is a type of acute necrosis, see GI lectures for more. Look out for bleeding due to ulceration after erosion into a vessel.
- Enzymes from necrotic cells are detectable in the blood because they're able to leak out! "Cellular enzymes rise in serum after necrosis."

###  Apoptosis
- "Falling off," an orchestrated, active cell death.
- Some of the various proteins involved in apoptosis:
- **Caspase**: contains cysteine, cleaves aspartase. Big players are Caspase 8, 9, and 3, the end result is activation of endonucleases to cleave nuclear DNA.
- **Fas or CD95**: destiny or fate, member of the TNF receptor family
- **FLIP**: FLICE inhibitor protein.
- **Apaf**: apoptosis activating factor
- **Bcl**: "B-cell lymphoma" - a family of anti-apoptotic proteins
- **Bax**: Bcl-associated X protein: pro-apoptic effectors
- Overview of Apoptosis:
- Path 1: Fas-Receptor (CD95) pathway: CD95 binds with FAS ligans, like TNF. This activates the cytoplasmic **"death domain"**, which activates **caspase-8**, which activates **caspase-3** and then endonuclease activity.
- Path 2: Mitochondrial route: happens due to poor homeostatic control of **Bcl-2**, which is usually maintained by external signaling (e.g. estrogen in the menstrual cycle) binding to cell survival factor receptors, and leading to maintenance of Bcl-2 expression. The mitochondria will then leak **cytochrome C**, activating **apaf-1** then **caspase-9**, which turns on **capase-3** and then endonuclease activity.
- Path 3: Free radicals, ischemia, chemotherapy: leads to DNA damage, which increases **TP53** an intermediate to **BAX**, a proapoptotic factor in the Bcl-2 (hence mitochondrial) pathway. 
- _**Microscopic features**_: Peripheral condensation of chromatin, pyknosis (darkening and shrinking of the nucleus), nuclear fragmentation, condensed, eosinophilic cytoplasm, apoptotic body formation. Sequestration of the apoptotic cell by phagocytes. Despite these, often difficult to tell between a necrotic cell and an apoptotic cell using light microscopy!
