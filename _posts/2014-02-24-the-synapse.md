### The Synapse
- Principle idea: neurons are connected to each other, but they are physically separated. That separation is the synaptic cleft. Transmission goes electrical to chemical back to electrical.
- Signal is only transmitted when the pre-synaptic membrane is depolarized. The first event at the synapse is the depolarization by an action potential.
- Quantal release: vesicle release is a "unitary" event, that is, you can have 1 vesicle, 2 vesicles, 20, etc...
- Synaptic vesicle release. Vesicle is connected to calcium channels and SNARE proteins, which position the vesicle near the membrane, improving the efficiency of transmission.
- There are hundreds of proteins associated with synaptic vessels, allowing specific functions: **synapsins** bind to reserve pool, **synaptobrevin** binds to synaptic membrane, **synaptotagmins** bind calcium, and **SV2s** allow vesicle fusion.
- Steps in vesicle exocytosis: first, **docking**; then **priming**. Once primed, vesicles will readily release upon stimulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>.
- Neurotransmitter loading into vesicles: different vesicles will have particular transport proteins, to determine which specific transmitter the vesicle will carry. The interior of the vesicle is also rather acidic, because protons are pumped in.
- **Calcium channels**: voltage gated channel, activated by action potentials. Positioned next to vesicle docking site. Partly. Low threshold: sensitive to small swings in membrane potential. High threshold: takes larger action potentials to illicit response. Calcium channels open after a slight delay (0.5 milliseconds). This graph shows that  peak calcium influx occurs as the action potential is ending, and there's also still calcium influx after the action ends. Decline in calcium influx reflects timeline for calcium channel closure. "A lot of the synaptic delay is due to the activation and reactivation of calcium channels."

- **Roles of voltage-gated channels**: Sodium channels generate action potential depolarization. Potassium channels induce recovery hyperpolarization in action potential. Calcium channels initiate synaptic release and muscle contraction.
- **Don't want mistakes**: Safety factor, but not very responsive to calcium... work around is to position the calcium channels right next to the membrane, so they
- **Transmitter release is quantal**: Quantal content: how many quanta are released. Quantal size: how much transmitter is in a vesicle. 
- **Depolarization is exciting** - EPSP - Excitatory post-synaptic potential, if post-synaptic neuron is made more positive. IPSP - inhibitory post-synaptic potential, makes the post-synaptic neuron more negative. EPSPs in skeletal muscle are much larger than in the brain (20-40 mV vs. 1 mV)

### Sequence of Synaptic Events
- **#1** - Calcium channel activation
- **#2** - Vesicular release
- **#3** - Receptor activation
- **#4** - Auto-receptor activation (pre-synaptic feedback)
- **#5** - Extrasynaptic diffusion
- **#6** - Uptake / degradation (removal of neurotransmitter from synapse)
- **#7** - Vesicle recycling

### Post-synaptic Receptors
- **Ionotropic receptors** - sub-millisecond time scale. EPSPs: if open **cation** (Na/K/Ca) channels. **Acetylcholine**: fast, found at neuromuscular junction. **Glutamate**: major fast excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS. **IPSPs**: open **chloride** channels. GABA: major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS. Glycine: major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS.
- **Metabotropic receptors** - G-protein coupled receptors, activates G-protein on cytoplasmic side. 7 transmembrane domains.
- Example - The ionotropic acetylcholine receptor: Five subunits, each with 4 transmembrane domains. Optimally activated by the binding of two molecules of ACh.

### Regulation of synapse
- Synaptic receptors are major targets of pharmacological intervention!
- **Anxiety**: benzodiazepenes promote an increase in channel opening by increasing affinity for GABA. Anxiety may be a lack or reduced activity of GABA!
- **Myasthenia gravis**: autoimmune disease, inhibition of acetylcholine esterase promotes action of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction.
- **Parkinson's disease**: L-dopa increases supply of dopamine for synaptic release
- **Depression**: selective serotonin uptake inhibitors increase neurotransmitter levels at the synapse
- **Auto-receptor Feedback**: need to understand the concept that while a neurotransmitter may diffuse across the synaptic cleft and effect post-synaptic receptors, but also affect receptors on the pre-synaptic cell surface, which in t
