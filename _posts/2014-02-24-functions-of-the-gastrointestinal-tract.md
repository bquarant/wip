### Lecture Objectives

<span><br></span>

##Recall the basic chemical structures of gastrin, GIP, secretin, and CCK. Know how these compounds are structurally related and which part of each molecule is most important to physiological function.
- Gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), secretin, and Gastric Inhibitory Peptide (GIP) are the four "true" hormones that are produced in response to a meal and at physiological tissue concentrations.
- Gastrin and CCK is the first group; gastrin regulates the stomach and two major 17 and 34 AA forms. The N-terminal peptide <code>Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe</code> is the minimal fragment for strong activity. CCK is a longer peptide released in response to fats that functions to regulates the pancreas, but again has a N-terminal <code>SO<sub>2</sub>H-Tyr-Met-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe</code> that has 5 overlapping residue similarity with gastrin. The sulfonated tyrosine is also important! This N-terminal fragment is the minimal component for CCK activity.
- Secretin and GIP is the second group. Commonalities are alpha-helical structures with common locations of particular amino acids.

##Identify the cell type and anatomical location of the endocrine cells releasing gastrin, secretin, CCK, and GIP (need future lectures).

##Describe the histo-anatomical characteristics of the intrinsic nervous system. Given either a cross section or a longitudinal section of the intestine, name and locate the myenteric and submucosal plexus.

##Contrast the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and purinergic modulation of the enteric nervous system. Classify the following enteric nervous system neurotransmitters as excitatory or inhibitory: Norepinephrine, ACH, VIP, and NO.

<span><br></span>

##Describe the similarities and differences in regulating gastrointestinal function by nerves, hormones and paracrine regulators.

<span><br></span>

##Know the intracellular signaling mechanisms (second messenger pathways) that mediate the action of ACH, CCK, gastrin, VIP, histamine, and secretin (need future lectures).
