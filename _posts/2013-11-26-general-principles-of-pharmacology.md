### Drug receptor definition
- a specific macromolecular constituent of the biological system with which a drug interacts to produce an effect

### Types of receptors
- Membrane-embedded enzymes
- Ligand-gated ion channels
- G-protein coupled receptors
- Transcription factors


### Classification and Nomenclature of Drugs
- By pharmacological effects / therapeutic uses
- By name: chemical, generic, trade
- e.g., fluoxetine / Prozac

## Multiple Receptors & Selective Toxicity
- Example: Lidocaine
- Functions on peripheral nerves to provide local anesthetic
- Functions on myocardium as antiarrythmic, but can also lead to cardiovascular collapse and death.
- Functions on CNS: restlessness, tremors, seizure activity

### Multiple Receptors
- *Tamoxifen* - a selective estrogen receptor modulator for hormone-sensitive breast cancer. Has effects on both reproductive and non-reproductive tissues.

### Selective Toxicity
- Attempt to influence one type of living cell without affecting the others, even when they are close neighbors.
- Examples: bacteria vs. mammalian; cancer vs. non-cancer

### Stereocomplementarity
- Carbon has sp3 hybrid orbitals, so stereochemistry is relevant to pharmacology, both for the drug and receptor.
- Pasteur: enantiomorphs of tartaric acid
- Fischer: emulsin and maltase on methyl-glucosides (Lock and Key)
- Structure-activity relationship; example: opioids with phenyl ring modifications
- Stereoselectivity of receptors: *levorphanol* - analgesic / antitussive; *dextromorphan* - antitussive
- Make racemic mixtures, or do not.
- SSRI stereochemistry: *citalopram* - racemic mixture of \[R\]-/\[S\]-citalopram; *escitalopram* - pure \[S\]-citalopram
