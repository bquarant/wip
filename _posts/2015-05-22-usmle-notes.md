- **Parinaud's syndrome**: aka dorsal midbrain syndrome, pineal/germinoma mass effect on rostral interstitial nucleus of MLF causing vertical gaze palsy...
- **Pilocytic astrocytoma**: pediatric cerebellar brain tumor, p/w ataxia, nausea, headache, increased ICP
- **Alkaptonuria**: autosomal recessive congenital deficiency of homogentisate oxidase, an enzyme in the pathway that breaks down tyrosine into fumarate (TCA cycle intermediate). This is usually benign condition, but urine can turn black if allowed to oxidize. Can present with ochronosis, which is dark connective tissue and brown sclerae. Debilitating arthralgias from homogentistic acid toxicity vs. cartilage.
- **Homocystinuria**:  autosomal recessive intellectual disability, tall stature, osteoporosis, kyphosis, lens subluxation, thrombosis, and atherosclerosis. Labs show increased homocysteine in the urine. Three subtypes: (1) **cystathione synthase deficiency**: treat with increased cysteine, B12, and folate in diet, (2) decreased affinity of CS for B6 cofactor, treat with increased B6, and (3) **homocysteine methyltransferase deficiency**, treat with increased methionine in diet. 
- **Peroxisomes**: location for breakdown of VLCFA's + certain amino acids.
- **CD31** - PECAM1 - platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule + arsensic or polyvinyl chloride exposure --> liver angiosarcoma
