Epidemiology
**Relative Risk**: risk of the outcome in exposed vs. unexposed.
RR = [ a / ( a + b ) ] / [ c / ( c + d ) ]

**Attributable Percent Risk**: represents the excess risk in the exposed population attributable to the risk factor
ARPexposed = 100 x 	[ ( RR - 1 ) / RR ]

Factoids:
- b/l ACA occlusion: LE n/w/t + abulia + urinary incontinence (frontal micturition center in mesial frontal lobe)
- Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome: pancreatic tumors secret gastrin, stimulates ECL cells to release histamine --> H2R --> ^ cAMP --> ^ H+ --> ulcer
- Systemic mastocytosis: mast cell proliferation in bone marrow, p/w pruritis, rash, flushing, n/v, syncope, hypotension
- Colon cancer: stepwise k-ras --> p53 --> DCC. Evidence of ^ COX-2 activity .:. take aspirin
- isoniazid resistant TB: d/t catalase-peroxidase non-expression || change to mycolic acid synthesis enzyme
- conus medullaris syndrome: more mild L2 lesion, flaccid bladder/rectum + mild leg weakness
- cauda equina syndrome: massive L2 lesion, red flags
- FEV1/FVC ratio should be >= 80%.
- PE pathophys: thrombus --> V/Q mismatch --> hypoxemia --> hyperventilation --> respiratory alkalosis. pH high, O2/CO2 low.
- Fragile X syndrome: FXMR1 has CGG repeats, C-hypermethylation leads to gene inactivation; p/w MR, facies, macroorchidism
- Grave's disease treatment = thionamides (TPO inhibitors), but beware for agranulocytosis if presents with infectious symptoms!
- Inteferon mechanism: suppress viral replication, induce apoptosis of infected cells by means of degrading mRNA and impairing protein synthesis. 
- Cryptococcus: dx w/ LP and India Ink/Sabourad culture. Treat: amphotericin B + flucytosine --> fluconazole
- SGLT2 inhibitors: lead to significant urinary glucose loss. Check BUN/CR, watch for mycotic UTIs...
- Actinomycosis: gram-positive anaerboes, grow in mouth, colon, teeth of poor dentition. Can aspirate --> pulmonary actinomycosis. Dx: filamentous branching patterns and sulfur granules. Tx: penicillin.
- Methotrexate: preferred DMT for RA. SAEs: stomatitis, LFT delta.
- Reaction formation: transformation of an unacceptable impulse or emotion to its opposite
- Congenital syphilis: presents with "H"utchinson incisors, "mulberry" molars.
- Conn syndrome: aldosterone-secreting adrenal adenoma --> Na+ retention, K+ excretion --> hypertension + hypokalemia --> metabolic acidosis + hypokalemic parathesias.
- Eisenmenger syndrome: reversal of shunt flow through congenital cardiac defect due to chronic pulmonary hypertension
- Beck's triad: hypotension, distended neck veins, muffled heart sounds, tachycardia --> cardiac tamponade
- Pulsus paradoxus: reduction in SBP < 10 mmHg during inspiration --> cardiac tamponade
- Phlegmasia alba dolens - "painful white leg" due to iliofemoral thrombosis during pregnancy (hypercoaguability + gravid uterus compression of venous structures).

Test 1 - Felt pretty good, scored 65% vs. mean of 58%. Lots of room for improvement, of course, but a step in the right direction....
Test 2 - Felt a little better, might have been a little bit easier? Also, ran into two classmates during this block which was a nice break.

Correct Low  % 32 , 33, 38, 42
Wrong High %  82 (oral thrush)

### Tue May 5
### 7:11pm
### UB North Campus
- Von Hippel Lindau: mutated VHL (chr 3) leading to constitutive expression of HIF and angiogenic factors --> cavernous hemangiomas, RCC, hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytomas
- Chronic Granulomatous disease: NADPH oxidase deficiency --> no ROS formation in PMNs, recurrent catalase+ infections...
- Niemann-Pick A: sphingomyelinase deficiency builds up in PMN --> "foamy histiocytes" in liver, spleen, skin, CNS. p/w regression of milestones, hypotonia, cherry-red spot, hepatosplenomegaly.  
- Kartagener's Syndrome: chronic sinusitis, bronchitis, situs inversus: d/t dynein mutation, 

### Wed May 6
### 5:24pm
### UB North Campus - Davis Hall
- **McCune-Albright Syndrome**: survivable if mosaic mutation occurs; p/w precocious puberty + unilateral cafe-au-lait + polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (fibrous dysplasia + sclerotic bone). Precocious puberty due to autonomous G-protein stimulation (prevents cAMP downregulation). Mutation: GNAS1 on 20q13.3.
- **Heteroplasmy**: presence of both normal and mutated mtDNA.
- **Uniparental disomy**: two copies of a chromosome from one parent, none from the other. Consider UPD when recessive disorder presenting with only one parent who is a carrier. Also can occur with imprinting disorders.
- **Heterodisomy**: indicates meiosis I error
- **Isodisomy**: indicates meiosis II error or postzygotic chromosome duplication	  
- **Hardy-Weinberg Population genetics**: p + q = 1; p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1. 2pq = frequency of heterozygosity or carrier frequency. If XL recessive, frequency in males  = q, females = 2q.
- **Prader-Willi syndrome**: chromosome 15 **P**aternal gene deleted, maternal gene normally methylated: p/w MR, hypotonia, hypogonadism, hyperphagia. 25% d/t maternal UPD.
- **Angelman syndrome**: chromosome 15 **m**aternal gene deleted, paternal gene normally methylated: p/w/ MR, ataxia, seizures, "inappropriate laughter". 5% d/t maternal UPD.
- **X-linked dominant inheritance**: Mothers (X-X) transmit to 50% of daughters and sons. Fathers (X-Y) transmit to 100% of daughters, 0% of sons. Example: hypophosphatemic rickets.
- **Mitchondrial myopathies**: p/w myopathy, lactic acidosis, CNS disease d/t oxidative phosphorylation defect. Biopsy shows "ragged red fibers." Variable expression due to heteroplasmy.

### Thu May 7

### UB North Campus - Alfeiro Business center

- Plummer-Vinson syndrome: difficulty swallowing, esophageal webs, atrophic glossitis, and iron deficiency anemia. Treatent:  iron supplementation and mechanical widening of the esophagus. Increased risk for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
- Volume of Distribution (Vd) = amount of drug in the body / plasma drug concentration
- Half-life facts: Property of 1st order excretion, a drug infused at a constant rate takes 4-5 half-lives to reach steady state; 3.3 half-lives and you're at 90% of steady state level. Formula: t1/2 = 0.693 x Vd / clearance
- Clearance = rate of elimination of the drug / plasma drug concentration, or Vd x  Ke (elimination constant).
- **Mydriasis**: contraction of the pupillary dilator muscle through alpha-1 pathway... constriction of pupil is called **miosis**, which is mediated through muscarinic-3 pathway, which also is responsible for accomodation. Both use Gq!
-  **Ortner syndrome**: mitral stenosis --> LA dilation --> recurrent laryngeal nerve impingment
