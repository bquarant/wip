### TODO
- Complete lecture objectives
- Clean up: Slides 1-6!

<span><br></span>


### Horner Syndrome
- Sympathetic "tone" is set for a variety of structures!

<!-- TODO: Shrink by 25% -->

### The efferent autonomic neurons
- There are pre-and post-ganglionic neurons!
- **First synapse**: Preganglionic synapse - ionotropic acetylcholine receptors (nicotinic receptors) in both the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems. 
- **Second synapse**: Postganglionic synapse - metabotropic receptors. Slow, diffuse. Parasympathetic: use acetylcholine again, called muscarinic receptors. Sympathetic: use norepinephrine, called adrenergic receptors.
- **Example**: Parasympathetic release of nitric oxide -  some parasympathetic neurons release NO, which stimulates guanylate cyclase, making cGMP. cGMP then enhances smooth muscle relaxation and dilation, causing penile erection. There is a phosphodiesterase (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum and smooth muscle which breaks down cGMP to GMP. Thus, inhibiting PDE5 leads to enhancement of the parasympathetic signals.

### CNS control of the autonomic nervous system

### Somatic neuromuscular junction
- One, discrete synaptic contact betwen the nerve and the skeletal muscle, produces an all-or-none twitch response in the muscle.
- Large EPSP at the synapse produces a safety factor for action potential generation.

### Autonomic post-ganglionic synapse
- Contrasts with the somatic neuromuscular junction!
- Varicosities: axon of the post-ganglionic autonomic neuron forms many small outpouchings within the smooth muscle cells, there is **no synaptic cleft!**em reduces blood supply to the gut
- **Impact**: large area, slow acting, long duration, graded response.
- Uses metabotropic receptors, either excitatory or inhibitory.

### Sympathetic efferent circuit to the gut
- Sympathetic system reduces blood supply to the guy and acts on the ENS to suppr
