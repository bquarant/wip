### Horner Syndrome
- Sympathetic "tone" is set for a variety of structures!

### The efferent autonomic neurons
- There are pre-and post-ganglionic neurons!
- **First synapse**: Preganglionic synapse - ionotropic acetylcholine receptors (nicotinic receptors) in both the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems. 
- **Second synapse**: Postganglionic synapse - metabotropic receptors. Slow, diffuse. Parasympathetic: use acetylcholine again, called muscarinic receptors. Sympathetic: use norepinephrine, called adrenergic receptors.
- **Example**: Parasympathetic release of nitric oxide -  some parasympathetic neurons release NO, which stimulates guanylate cyclase, making cGMP. cGMP then enhances smooth muscle relaxation and dilation, causing penile erection. There is a phosphodiesterase (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum and smooth muscle which breaks down cGMP to GMP. Thus, inhibiting PDE5 leads to enhancement of the parasympathetic signals.

### CNS control of the autonomic nervous system

### Somatic neuromuscular junction
- One, discrete synaptic contact betwen the nerve and the skeletal muscle, produces an all-or-none twitch response in the muscle.
- Large EPSP at the synapse produces a safety factor for action potential generation.

<span><br></span>

### Autonomic post-ganglionic synapse
- Contrasts with the somatic neuromuscular junction!
- Varicosities: axon of the post-ganglionic autonomic neuron forms many small outpouchings within the smooth muscle cells, there is **no synaptic cleft!**em reduces blood supply to the gut
- **Impact**: large area, slow acting, long duration, graded response.
- Uses metabotropic receptors, either excitatory or inhibitory.

### The enteric nervous system
- Part of the nervous system contained within the gastrointestinal system.
- "Second brain" or "gut's brain"
- Consists of 100 million neurons, equivalent to spinal cord.
- **Myenteric plexus (Auerbach)** - controls motility, located between circular and longitudinal muscles and reciprocally controls these muscles. Acetylcholine is excitatory, NO is inhibitory. 
- **Submucosal plexus (Meissner)** - secretion and contraction of muscularis mucosa
- Sympathetic system has a relatively small ole in the gut, mainly acts to override slow motility and decrease secretions during the flight or fight response. ENS receives post-ganglionic (adrenergic) input from sympathetic neurons.
- Parasympathetic system (via vagus nerve) is dominant, and activates nicotinic receptors. Post-ganglionic cell is the enteric nervous system.
- **Sensory neurons of the enteric system**: Myenteric plexus has mechano-sensitive recepctors which respond to stretch and tension. Submucosal plexues has mechano-sensitive and chemical receptors sensitive to lumenal content (such as acid, glucose, fats, and amino acids.) 
- All motor neurons in the ENS myenteric and submucosal plexus are stimulated by acetylcholine.
- The local circuit: sensory neurons detect chemical or mechanical stress, which then stimulate muscle cells appropriately...
- **The Vago-vagal reflex**: Sensory receptors send signals to vagal nerve along sensory afferent fibers, back to the medulla, synapsing most likely on the nucleus of solitary tract, then to the dorsal motor complex, then project vagal motor efferents back to the enteric nervous system for selective stimulation and inhibition of muscle cells.

- **Achalasia**: degeneration of inhibitor myenteric neurons leading to decreased NO and VIP, making it so that the lower esophageal sphincter does not sufficiently relax during esophageal peristalsis, making it hard to swallow! "Not opening the sphincter sufficiently."
- **Acid reflux**: H+ stimulates vago-vagal reflex; sensory ENS neurons detect low pH in esophagus, which stimulate vagal afferents, which activate vagal efferents that contract the lower esophageal sphincter. "Not closing the sphincter sufficiently."

### Enteric Stomach Reflex Circuits
- **Taste reflex pathway**: taste and olfactory receptors stimulate the dorsal motor complex, stimulating vagus efferent fibers, causing acetylcholine release to stimulate the ENS, which then stimulates parietal cells (acid) and chief cells (pepsinogen).
- **Stomach - Receptive relaxation**: stomach can serve as a reservoir, volume inside increases. Nitric oxide is released by ENS cells, inhibiting muscle contraction. 
- **Emptying the stomach**: generally... Also, sympathetic nervous system can induce contraction of the pyloric valve via alpha-adrenergic receptors.
