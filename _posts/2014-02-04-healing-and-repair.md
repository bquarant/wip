### TODO
- FOLLOW UP ON STAGES OF HEALING
- Complete learning objectives

<span><br></span>

### Learning Objectives
- complete!

<span><br></span>

### "Healing is not a science but the art of wooing nature"
- ReconstructioN; regeneration of tissue
- Partial reconstruction: some regeneration, some scar.
- Scar formation: clinical significance depends on location (i.e. scar in the heart is instantly fatal vs. superficial skin).
- Purposes of repair: stop bleeding, prevent infection, fill in the defect (ie laceration), pull tissue back together (through wound contraction)

<span><br></span>

### Tissue Regeneration
- The more regeneration, the less scar.
- Regeneration depends on tissue type. **Labile** cells have constant turnover and replacement, but a short life span (e.g. bone marrow, epithelium, epidermis). **Stable cells**: able to turn over if stimulated (i.e. bone, hepatocytes). **Permanent cells**: little ability to turn over (i.e. muscle, nerve).
- Epidermis is labile, but scar formation still?! Resolving the paradox: the scar is formed from lower dermal layers!

### Scar Formation
- **Granulation tissue** (don't confuse with granuloma *test*): defintion - numerous vessels that look like granules. Composed of proliferating capillaries (stimulated by **VEGF and BFGF** made by macrophages, themselves being stimulated by **HIF**), fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, extracellular matrix, and inflammatory cells (mostly macrophages).
- Angiogenesis: breakdown of the basement membrane around the existing vessels, migration and chemotaxis of endothelial cells ("sprout"), proliferation mediated by **VEGF and BFGF**, lumen formation, and then finally increased permeability through gaps and transcytosis leading to **edema**.
- Other facts about angiogenesis: (1) angioblasts can come from the bone marrow and start this process, but also just like the diagram endothelial cells do it too. Signaling molecules: **VEGF** is an early factor, Ang1 later, and Ang2 is a late inhibitory signal. **VEGF** 
- Granulation tissue is weak and is eventually broken down by matrix metalloproteinases, serine proteases, and elastases. Vessels are gradually reduced in number (scars are avascular) and inhibited by **Ang2**. Macrophages begin to produce FGFs and TGF-B, which stimulate fibroblast proliferation and migration. Fibroblasts begin making collagen, initially Type III collage and later converted to Type I collagen which is stronger. Wound strength a proportion of cross-linking.
- Disadvantages: not as strong as original tissue. Data shows that surgical sutured wound strength is only going to get about 80% of baseline after three months. Scars also may interfere with function (see: heart and kidney infarcts), or they may be disfiguring.

### Wound Healing
- Healing by primary intention: minimal tissue separation, e.g.
- Healing by secondary intention
- Q: Why is the scar white? A: There are no vessels!

<span><br></span>

### Special types of wound healing
- Fibrosis without granulation tissue: hyalinized renal glomeruli in DM, scarring in granulomas.
- Unique patterns of fibrosis: cirrhosis of the liver, tumor encapsulation.

<span><br></span>

### Variants and complications of normal wound healing
- Excessive granulation tissue: Likely mediated by FLT-4, a VEGF ligand.
- Excessive scar tissue: Hypertrophic or keloid scar, looks kind of a like a tumor. More common in African Americans. Current thought is that it is related to **WNT** activation, which prevents **b-catenin** degradation, which leads to fibroblast proliferation.
- Defective scar formation: herniation of the wound, wound dehiscence, failure of wound closure
- Dystrophic calcification: deposition of calcium in the tissue. Seen in atherosclerosis, aging heart valves, granulomas, tumors. Occurs at site of injury. Basophilic (i.e. blue)! Intracellular: starts in the mitochondria. Extracellular: starts with dead cells. Calcium binds to membrane or vesicular phosophlipids. Phosphatases generate phosphate, **CaPO<sub>4</sub>** microcrystals form, cycle repeats. **Crystallization propagation** occurs, forming deposits. Matrix proteins like **osteopontin** facilitate the propagation.
- Delayed wound healing: infection, aging, diabetes, poor blood supply (i.e. vascular disease).

### Advances in wound treatment
- Silver (silvadene): topical antimicrobial
- Smart dressings: contain growth factors like PDGF (becaplemin)
- Negative pressure devices: provides a sealed, protected moist environment
- Hyperbaric chamber
- Platelet rich plasma (PRP): contains growth factors and platelets, orthopods now injecting this directly into the surgical field
