### Introductory Remarks
- Today's lecture on mucosal immunity, brought to us by Dr. Russell of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, covered a lot of important basic science, but was lacking in direct clinical applications (outside of passing references to C. difficile and parasitic infections), despite the opening salvo regarding the fact that 90% of the most common fatal pathogens are mucosally acquired. I definitely learned a lot about the IgA molecule and its metabolism, and the concept of the compartmentalized mucosal vs. systemic components of mucosal immunity was new to me, well described, and thought-provoking.
- Improving this lecture by closing the loop with thoughts on why exactly so many of these common pathogens are so successful at being mucosally acquired would be beneficial.

### Overview of Mucosal Immunity
- Mucosal tissues comprise the oral cavity, GI/GU tract, respiratory tract, conjunctiva, middle ear, salivary, and mammary glands
- 90% of the deaths due to the top 10 infectious pathogens are mucosally acquired.
- There's also a huge amount of commensal bacteria living in this mucosa: 10^14
- Mucosal tissues produce 80% IgA, 13% IgM, then others. Systemic tissues produce only about ~30% IgA.
- IgA concentrations in human body fluids: colostrum> serum > intestinal fluid > others.
- More IgA than IgG produced per day per human.
- Mucosal immune responses are a balance between active protective immunity towards pathogens and tolerance towards commensals and food antigens.
- Mucosal tolerance: systemic tolerance can be induced after antigenic introduction via the oral route.
- But! Mucosal tolerance and mucosal antibody responses can coexist, mediated through regulatory T cells secreted molecules (TGF-B, IL-10, and IL-4) which decrease Th1 and Th2 but increase B cells (and hence \[pIgA\])

### Functional Features of Mucosal Immunity
- Local vs. disseminated ('common') immune responses
- Cells induced in inductive sites migrate via circulation to effector sites
- Positive vs. Negative responses, goal to discriminate between pathogens (harmful), commensals (non-threatening), and food (hopefully harmless).

### Immunoglobulin A (IgA)
- Three major types of IgA: monomeric, polymeric, and secretory.
- Monomeric IgA is the predominant form in circulation
- Polymeric IgA is produced by the mucosal immune system, and also has a J chain.
- Secretory IgA is a result from processing by the mucosal immune system, and has the J chain plus a secretory component (SC)
- Secretory IgA is also heavily glycosylated, making it hydrophilic and carrying a net negative charge. This is great for the mucosa, and unlike other types of immunoglobulins.
- Biological activity of IgA: neutralization of enzymes and toxins, inhibition of microbial adherence to mucosa and uptake, and also some role for pIgA in intraceullular viral neutralization.
- Of note, IgA does not activate the classical or alternate complement pathways, though you might be able to detect some increase in complement components. "You don't want to be punching holes in your mucosa!"
- Human IgA is susceptible to cleavage at the "hinge" by bacterial proteases. There's a sequence repeat this region of IgA, but with varying glycosylation; but due to the different cleavage sites, it means that several different pathogens evolved this ability independently.
- Both IgA and S-IgA are present, but only at very low levels at birth. Levels increase notably over the first six months (S-IgA > IgA)
- Secretory IgA pathway: IgA is produced and polymerized with the J chain within the plasma cell, then exocytosed. It binds to the epithelial cell's pIgR receptor, which it forms a disulfide bond with after endocytosis. The SC peptide is actually a component of the pIgR. S-IgA secreted via normal vesicular exocytosis.

### Systemic and Mucosal IgA Compartments - An Overview
- The figure on slide 14 shows the two "compartments" involved in IgA metabolism.
- The systemic compartment involves the hematopoetic centers, and produces approximately 1.5g IgA per day, with most of it going into circulation and most of that getting catabolized by the liver.
- The system compartment makes primarily monomeric IgA1. A small amount of this does make it to mucosal surfaces!
- The mucosal compartment includes the organs typically thought of as mucosa: nasopharynx, respiratory tract, salivary glands, intestinal tract, genitourinary tract, and mammary glands.
- The mucosal compartment makes more IgA (approximately 3 g/d), and the majority of this is polymeric with equal amounts of IgA1 and IgA2.
- Because of these two separate compartments, measuring IgA in the blood will tell you very little about the IgA metabolism in the mucosa.

### The "Common" Mucosal System
- Overview: mucosal lymphocytes are found in organized tissues where immune responses are induced, and then are distributed throughout the lamina propria where they perform effector functions.
- Essentially, we need to know that there's different areas where lymphoid cells are exposed to environment antigens (tonsils, BALT, GALT), which then move to the lymph nodes and then eventually stimulated B and T cells enter the blood stream.
- They return to their initial sites of origin via a "selective homing process" that is mediated by receptors and vascular addressins.
- "M" cells are specialized epithelial cells which "sample" antigens from whatever lumen they might be facing, pack these antigens up in vesicles, and then give them to the APCs.
- Waldeyer's Ring: Adenoids, palantine tonsil, lingual tonsil, and tongue form a ring of organized mucosal inductive site tissue at the entrance of the gut and airway:

### The Three tiers of IgA-mediated protection at mucosal surfaces
1. Intraluminal: secreted IgA binds and neutralizes pathogens and toxins.
2. Intraepithelial: Intracellular inhibition of viral replication and neutralization of LPS.
3. Subepithelial (hepatobiliary): pIgA can complex with antigens before binding with the epithelial cells, and then the antigen is removed when S-IgA is secreted.

### Other Facts
- Intra-epithelial lymphocytes are CD8+ T cells that are found in between the epithelial cells. In a stained section, they'll be the green stain within the keratinized blue border.
- If commensal bacteria are suppressed by antibiotics, pathogens like C. diff can get a foothold, secrete toxins and damage the mucosal damage and pseudomembranous colitis.
- Both adaptive (S-IgA Ab) and innate (defensins, antimicrobial peptides, mucins) are important for mucosal immunity!
- Th2-driven responses are important for defense against parasitic worms, using several mechanisms including (1) increased cell turnover and shedding, (2) increased M2 macrophage activity, (3) IL-4 activation of B cells to produce IgE, (4) IL-5 activation of eosinophils, (5) IL-9 and IL-3 activation of mast cells (vasoactive amines, proteases)
