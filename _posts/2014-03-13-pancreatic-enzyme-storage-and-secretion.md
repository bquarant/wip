### Medical Relevance
- **Pancreatitis**: release and activation of digestive enzymes; wrong place, wrong time.
- **Entry of Viruses into Cells**: HIV, Influenza
- **Botox and Tetanus Toxin**: fatal food poisoning, cosmetics, medical uses
- **Pancreatic part of cystic fibrosis**

### Regulation of Pancreatic Protease Secretion - Overview
- Pancreatic proteases (like trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase) play a major role in digestion, but must be stored as **inactive proproteins** in order to prevent autodigestion of the pancreas (i.e. pancreatitis)
- Also, they must be activated exactly where and when needed for digestion, so you have to regulation the secretion from the pancreas to the duodenum and regulate their activation in the duodenum.
- **Mechanisms**: (1) store in secretory vesicles or zymogen granules in acinar cells, (2) regulate the release of secretory vesicle contents and fusion of plasma membrane using signaling cascade and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and (3) activation of pancreatic proteases.

### The Sorting Problem
- **Specificity** of vesicles: need to get the right stuff, in the right place, at the right time.
- COat Proteins (COPI, COPII): Get right cargo into vesicles and sorting (i.e. destination). "COPs are trafficking". Coat proteins help you get to the right membrane. FFT: Coat proteins play pivotal roles in forming vesicles, determining their contents, and determining their destinations. Cargo receptor proteins recognize a **localization sequence** on soluble cargo protein in the lumen. Small G-proteins (ARFs) determine the **rate** of coat assembly and disassembly.
- Exact specificity is determined mainly by the fusion proteins: **V-SNARES** (vesicle) and **T-SNARES** (target membrane). **Small G** proteins (Rabs) are critical for these proteins to bind to each other!
- Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fusion and exocytosis

### Unique properties of secretory vesicles
- **Common** mechanism used for very different secretions (ATCH in pituitary, insulin in pancreas)
- Selective protein aggregation is key to distinguishing secretory from transport vesicles
- Vesicles from the trans-Golgi are coated with **clathrin**, and act as a scaffold to pinch off the vesicle.
- Secretory proteins aggregate **during budding** of the secretory vesicle from the trans-Golgi. Weakly acid pH, high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration within the vesicle. Aggregate with the help of two aggregating proteins, **chromogranin B** and **secretogranin II**
- Proteins that don't aggregate under these condition are packaged in **constitutively** secreted vesicles. "No Granins!"
- Secretory and transport vesicles used microtubules and microfilaments to move throughout the cell.
- Protein hormones are usually cleaved after the secretory vesicle leaves the Golgi during vesicle fusion and maturation.
- Pancreatic enzymes are also made as pro-proteins, but aren't cleaved until after exocytosis!

### Vesicle secretion
- Before secretion or emptying the vesicle, you need to remove the Coat proteins
- ARF-GTP = coat-on --> GTPase activity --> ARF-GDP = coat off
- Now, the "right" V-SNARE in the vesicle is going to meet up with the "right" T-SNARE already in the plasma membrane. Rabs required!

### Fusion of Vesicle and Target Membrane
- Specificity is determined by a highly conserved **family of homologous fusion proteins**
- These proteins determine specificity **and** trigger membrane fusion
- Specific transmembrane fusion proteins on donor membrane vesicle and target membrane acceptor
- Coat proteins must be removed (i.e. depolymerization) before V-SNARE can be exposed
- V-SNARE = specific membrane **v**esicle (donor)
- T-SNARE = specific **t**arget membrane (acceptor)
- SNAP25 = ubiquitous fusion protein in target membranes that is required for fusion
- NSF = ATPase that also helps fusion and dissociation of fusion complexes for turnover use of T-SNARES
- **Docking** occurs when specific V-SNAREs bind specific T-SNARES and SNAP25. After docking, there is **priming** and **superpriming**. Why? Position for rapid release fr calcium signaling!
- **Fusion** means mixing of the vesicle and plasma membrane phospholipids such that pore formation happens. Energetically difficult because the bilayers have to break!
- Then, the pore closes and V-SNAREs and T-SNAREs can be recycled
- Rab proteins = Small G proteins that facilitate and regulate the **rate of vesicle docking** and correct matching of V-SNAREs and T-SNAREs
- **Priming**: mediated by **munc** proteins, stabilize the V-SNARE:T-SNARE:SNAP25 complex
- **Super-priming**: mediating by **complexin**, puts vesicle in cocked position waiting for calcium trigger signal
- Calcium sensation on the super-primed vesicle mediated by **synaptoganin**
- V-SNARE and T-SNARE interaction has the largest negative delta G due to super tight supercoiling of the known supercoiling proteins, but requires the MUNC protein and calcium effects. Provides the energy to break the bilayer and let the contents out!

### Medical significance of fusion proteins
- Principal V-SNARE of synaptic vesicles is VAMP. *Clostridium botulinum* produces **botulinum-B toxin** which causes botulism, a syndrome concluding in paralysis and death. This toxin is a protease that cleaves V-SNARE, and without V-SNARE the synaptic vesicles containing acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction can't get targeted to the membrane, thus paralysis.
