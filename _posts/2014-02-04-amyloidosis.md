### Learning objectives
- Various types of amyloid and the diseases they produce
- Attributes of amyloid
- Mechanisms of amyloid formation and tissue destruction
- Methods of diagnosis

### Introductory clinical cases
- 45F with history of multiple myeloma presents with gradually worsening difficulty speaking. Physical examination finds macroglossia with subsequent exams showing continued enlargement of the tongue.
- 39F with history of arthritis, particularly of the hands consistent with rheumatoid arthritis. Labs showed IgM autoantibodies to IgG. Physical examination reveals hepatomegaly. Should liver biopsy be performed?
- 75M autopsy shows thickening of the endocardium of the left atrium, microscopically shows amorphous material between myocardial fibers when stained with congo red.

### Properties and pathophysiology of amyloid 
- Disease caused by extracellular deposits of fibrillar proteins, 23 different amyloid types.
- Originally discovered by Virchow in 1854, thought to be starch at first
- Amyloid turns brown with iodine, then blue when H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is added.
- Affinity for the dye **congo red**, after staining amyloid takes a salmon pink color.
- Green-yellow birefringence under polarized light with fibrillar B-pleated sheet ultrastructure 
- Amyloid is **insoluble** in tissue, **resistant** to proteolysis, **accumulates** once deposit, creates compression and leads to **pressure atrophy**. 
- Affected organs can be enlarged, firm, and waxy.
- **P component**: the "doughnut portion," not really amyloid, member of pentraxin family, not congophilic. It is a protein whose function is to stabilize the amyloid deposit. Made by the liver and circulates as an alpha-globulin precursor molecule **SAP** (related to CRP).
- **Types of amyloid proteins**: 23 currently known, all begin with A. Various general types include: immunoglobulin light chains, amyloid associated, transthyretin (prealbumin), beta-2-microglobulin, hormone-related (IAPP), beta-amyloid (brain).
- **Pathogenesis**: There is a stimulus of some sort, then cells that make the amyloid, then insoluble protein formation.

### AL (primary) amyloidosis
- "Primary amyloidosis" - amyloid is composed of immunoglobulin light chains, most usually lamba chains. Tends to lead to systemic disease. 
- Cause: **plasma cell dyscrasias**: myeloma-associated or plasma cell hyperplasia (more common!). 
- Pathology: deposits in the synovium lead to arthritis, deposits in the heart lead to heart failure and arrhythmia, macroglossia, and skin producing nodules
- Diagnostics: Blood work, peripheral smear
- Treatment: treat the multiple myeloma, no good treatment for the primary amyloidosis though.

### AA (secondary) amyloidosis
- "Secondary amyloidosis" - but probably the most common form
- Amyloid is derived from SAA, which is produced by the liver after being stimulated by **IL-1** and **IL-6**.
- Cause: **Chronic infection / inflammation-related**: osteomyelitis, kidney failure, but also deposits in liver, spleen, and intestine.
- **Familial Mediterranean Fever**: inherited disease, mutations in *MEFV* on 16p, codes for **pyrin** in PMNs. Disease characterized by intermittent acute attacks including fever, peritonitis, abdominal pain, acute arthritis, skin rash, and renal disease or nephrotic syndrome.
- Livers should not be biopsied due to blood vessel fragility and risk for fatal hemorrhage.

### ATTR (transthyretin) amyloidosis
- made in the choroid plexus and liver
- Precursor is **transthyretin (prealbumin)** which normally functions to transport thyroxine
- **Familial neuropathies**: dominant inheritance pattern, usually due to a single AA substitution
- **Amyloid cardiomyopathy**: *Senile* - 5-10% of elderly, no symptoms. *Familial* - clinical cardiomyopathy. Deposits typically in the left atrium and mainly subendocardial and not extensive. Think about this when you have familial cardiomegaly or CHF.
- New therapy using siRNA cleaves target mRNA, use nanoparticles to deliver the siRNA to hepatocytes, decrease circulating ATTR.

### B<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin amyloidosis
- Normal serum protein which is elevated in chronic renal disease
- Amyloid deposits in the synovium, tendons, and carpal ligament. Consider when patient presents with median nerve compression (carpal tunnel syndrome)

### Endocrine-related amyloidosis
- Occurs in most endocrine organs, mechanism of amyloid formation different in each organ.
- We'll cover more of this next year in Endocrine, but for now think about pancreatic amyloidosis in the setting of diabetes (islet amyloidosis).

### Diagnosis of amyloidosis
- Generalized (systemic): Usually AL or AA. Biopsy the rectal, gingival, or abdominal fat.
- Cardiac: myocardial biopsy
- Renal: kidney biopsy
- Liver: Avoid!!! Risk of hemorrhage.
