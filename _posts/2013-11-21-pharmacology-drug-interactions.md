### Summation \(Additivity\)
- The effect of two drugs given simultaneously is equal to the sum of their individual effects.

<span><br></span> 
### Potentiation \(Synergism\)
- The effect of two drugs is greater than the sum of their individual effects

<span><br></span> 
### Antagonism
- The effect of two drugs is less than the sum of their individual effects

## Types of Antagonism
- Non-pharmacological or physical antagonism  
  - Activated charcoal for adsorption of a toxin  
  - Chelation of heavy metals
  - Opposing effects at distinct sites: (e.g. NE vs. histamine on blood pressure)
- Pharmacological antagonism 
  - Two drugs interact either *directly* or *indirectly* with a common receptor to produce a net diminished effect.
  - __agonist__: a drug which has affinity for a receptor, and intrinsic activity at that receptor
  - __antagonist__: a drug which has affinity for a receptor but has no intrinsic activity
  - Formation of the antagonist-receptor complex does not produce a pharmacological response
  - __surmountable antagonism__ - "reversible," "competitive" model
  - __insurmountable antagonism__ - formation of covalent bonds

### Partial Agonists
- __partial agonist__: a drug whose intrinsic activity is > 0.0 but < 1.0
- Depending on the circumstances, a partial agonist may exhibit the properties of either an agonist or antagonist
- __Suboxone = buprenorphine + naloxone__: What is the rationale for combining a partial agonist and antagonist?

### Inverse Agonists and Constitutively Active Systems
- Chloride channel example: default state pore diameter approximately equal to diameter of chloride ion, normal flux.
- Addition of **agonist** causes decreased pore diameter, thus decreased chloride ion flux
- Addition of **inverse agonist*** causes increased pore diameter, thus increased chloride ion flux

### Therapeutic Index 
- __Selectivity__: The degree to which a drug acts upon a given site relative to all possible sites of interaction
- __Therapeutic Index__: ratio of the dose which produces toxic effects and the dose which produces the desired therapeutic effect
- The therapeutic index provides a quantitative assessment of the relative benefits and risks of a drug

### Heterogeneity of the Patient Population
- Log-dose response curve as a cumulative normal frequency distribution of sensitivities of the individual responsive units
- You can choose a linear or semi-logarithmic scale to plot the data; either way: find the x-intercept of 50% on Y-axis, this will give you K<sub>D</sub> = \[X\]
