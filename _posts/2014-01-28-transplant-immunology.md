### Objectives
- Why do we perform kidney transplants?
- Immunological barriers to successful transplantation
- Classes, mechanisms, and effects of immunosuppressive medications

### Overview of kidney transplantation
- 1954: first kidney transplantation
- 2011: 10,399 DDT, 4,922 LDT
- The waiting list is growing: yearly growth in the discrepancy of number of kidney candidates on the waiting list. Growth of DDT and LDT not keeping up.
- Kidney transplantation is cost effective and leads to improved lift expectancy, when looking at competing cost for dialysis and the increased mortality in dialysis patients
- Current system limitations include high discard rates, access variability due to geography and biology, and mismatch in graft/patient survival.
- Proposed classification: estimate post-transplant survival, looking at candidate age, time on dialysis, prior organ transplantation, and diabetes status
-

1. Using cyclosporine, graft survival jumped to 90%
2. TCR activated, then CD3 is phosphorylated, which activates IP3.
3. Calcium is released, binds to calcineurin and activates NFAT (nuclear factor activating T cells)

- Unfortunately, there is a side effect of the calcineurin inhibitors: renal fibrosis, caused by vasoconstriction and ACE sys
- Ironically, these kidneys fail from agent that allow the graft to be taken.

<!-- Slide 46 -->

-Imuran (Azathioprine): antimetabolite, supprsesses ($20/d)
-Until Cellcept (mycophenolic acid) ($1000/mo.)
-Inhibit DNA replication by DNA missense 
-Lymphocytes entirely depend on de novo nucleotide synthesis, mycophenolic acid acts only on the

- Rapamycin: blockade of the mTOR pathway. Prevents protein translation, causes immunosuppression.
- Used in combination with cyclosporine or alone, serum creatine is better. Does not cause renal fibrosis, but does lead to hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular problems.

Maintance
Tacrolimus: 7
Cellcept: 
Prednisone:

Sometimes, switch to cyclosporine if there's side effects.

Steroids good for preventing and reversing rejection
Use very low doses for long time!

- CTLA-4 is a negative signal to the cell, "turns off" the immune system by better competitive binding of the costimulatory molecule B7.
- Solubilized CTLA-4 now being used (Belatacept)

<!-- 57 -->
- CD40 ligand: patients had thrombotic events due to platelet expression of CD40
- Benefit of blocking this pathway: B-cells require this signal to make antibodies. CD40-/- patients have hyper IgM syndrome, 

Chronic Graft Loss is 
- vascular change primarily due to antibodies against the transplanted organ
- Peri-tubular capillary staining positive for complement: antibody mediated rejection
- Tell whether its against MHC I or II of their donor...
- Hopefully costimulation blockade is now the answer.

Treatment of Transplant Rejection
- Biopsy to Confirm Diagnosis
- Cellular Rejection
	- Solumedrol, high dose
	- rATG.
	- MONITOR CLOSELY FOR BK VIRUS
- Humoral Rejection
	- Plasmapheresis, Anti-CD20 (anti-B), and 
	- Follow DSA and B(CD19) cell numbers
	- This is a signal that the kidney is not going to last a very long time...

Transplant Medicine is a Balancing Act
- Over-immunosuppression: infections, fibrosis, tumors, bone disease, cardiovascular disease
- Under-immunosuppression: rejection, sub-clinical rejection, dnDSA, fibrosis
- "There is no blood pressure cuff for immunosuppression"

- Heart and liver transplants can become tolerant, kidneys cannot.
