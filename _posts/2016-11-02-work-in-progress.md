Getting this repository back to its original purpose.

## Thoughts

</div>

>"*Yes, it is critical that we ensure that our graduates are professionals, communicators, collaborators, leaders, health advocates, and scholars. But wouldn’t it be nice to also see “cutting surgeon” or “technical expert” in one of those fancy, acronym-derived Venn diagrams? A renewed focus on technical excellence can only be achieved through increased operative experience, surgical mentorship, and practical, honest evaluation on the local level and through leadership in establishing standards for surgical technical competency requirements on the national level. We must continue to be a glorious and free specialty; surgical excellence matters.*"
