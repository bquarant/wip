### Learning Objectives

<span><br></span>

### Overview of Blood Typing
- Naturally occurring antibodies occur in subjects who lack the corresponding antigens: Type A patients have anti-B antibodies; Type B patients have anti-A antibodies.
- Type AB have **neither** in their serum; Type O have **both** antibodies present in their serum; therefore the antigens present on the cell surface will be the opposite (AB have both antigens on RBC surface, O has neither on the surface.) Explains why O- is universal donor, because their RBCs are clean!
- Immune antibodies develop in response to foreign antigens: pregnancy, transfusion.

### Types of Transfusion
- Autodonation
- Direct donation
- Cell saver during surgery
- Irradiated red cells and platelets
- CMV-negative product
- Leukocyte-reduced packed cells (get the white cells out!!) "Lymphocytes cause a lot of trouble!"

### What can be transfused?
- pRBCs: anemia, hemorrhage
- Platelet concentrates: Use in bleeding patients regardless of platelet count, because PLT doesn't tell you about whether or not those platelets are functioning. Also use in thrombocytopenic patients (< 50k) or oncology patients (< 100k). Platelets have short half life!
- Granulocyte concentrates
- Human plasma
- Human albumin: volume expander, use during plasmapheresis
- Specific factor concentrates
- Immunoglobulin: use in hypogammaglobulinemia and autoimmune disorders
- **Fresh frozen plasma**: coagulation factors. Frozen within 8 hours of collection, contains all coagulation factors. Indicated for use in rapid reversal of coumadin, during massive transfusion, DIC, TTP, liver failure with coagulation defect, or Factor deficiency.
- Q: Why do you use FFP in TTP? A: ADAMTS-13 is in there!
- Cryoprecipitate: "heavy components of FFP" -- source of fibrinogen, Factor VIII, vWF, fibronectin, FSF. Indicated for use in Von Willebrand Disease, fibrinogen deficiency, 
- Activated protein C: severe sepsis

### Complications of Blood Transfusion
- Administrative issues: advise about risks and benefits, get informed consent, give right patient right blood. Transfuse blood slowly over 2-3 hours, vitaling them frequently through.
- Adverse reactions occur in 16% of all blood transfusions; reactions categorized as immunologic, infectious, chemical, physical, or early vs. late.
- **Early**: adverse reactions: hemolysis, allergy, bacteremia, fluid overload, TRALI (transfusion related acute lung injury)
- **Late**: transmission of infectious disease, transfusional iron overload, immune sensitization
- **Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction**: destruction of donor red cells by preformed antibodies; naturally occurring IgM anti-A or anti-B fix complement cause rapid intravascular hemolysis. DIC then ARF, then shock. Triad of fever, back pain, and red urine.
- **What to do**: Stop the blood, start vigorous saline infusion. Draw red top, STAT labs. Urinalysis. Return blood to bank, have them repeat crossmatch.
- Take home message: You need to think about every unit of blood that you transfuse, and ask - is it safe?

### Overview of Bone Marrow Transplantation
- HSCs can be sourced from the bone marrow, circulating stem cells, or umbilical cord blood.
- Patient's stem cells are harvested and frozen, patient requiring transplant is then treated with high doses of chemotherapy and radiation, and then is re-infused with stem cells.
- **Types of transplant**: autologous (self), allogeneic (non-self, family vs. match), syngeneic (twin)
- Use allogeneic transplant when the stem cells are the problem; use autologous in situations like multiple myeloma, hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
- **Complications**: #1 - Infection. Average time to immune recovery depends on cell line; PMNs 1 month, T-cells 6-12 months, B cells 12-24 months. Opportunistic infections (bacteria, Candida) move in quickly, after granulocyte recovery, concern for viruses and encapsulated bacteria. Prophylaxis with bactrim, quinolone, anti-fungal, and anti-viral agents. # 2 - Graft vs. Host disease. Only in patients with allogeneic transplants, donor cytotoxic lymphocytes attack normal host. Prophylaxis: cyclosporine, prednisone. **Other complications:** graft failure, vaso-occlusion, pulmonary.
- Take home message: Quality of the donor match matters, underlying disease state matter, age of the patient matters.
