### Overview
- Metabolic bone diseases are those disorders where there has been either abnormal initial bone development or in which there has been development of abnormal bone structure later in life.
- These disorders result in deficiencies in osteoid, deficiencies in mineralization, or other problems in turnover, all of which lead to weakening of the bone and increased risk for skeletal failure and fracture.
- Examples: Osteoporosis, Osteomalacia, osteitis fibrosa, Paget's disease, osteopetrosis
- **The Players**: Osteoblast: cells that make bone (via osteoid secretion and subsequent mineralization). Osteoblasts become osteocytes once fully encased in bone. Osteoclasts are the cells that break bone down.

### Bone remodeling
- Normally, bone formation and bone breakdown are continuous, coupled, and balanced: no net turnover!
- Cortical bone is more compact and is lower turnover (~3% per year) and is remodeled via cutting cones
- Cancellous bone is more spongy, with higher turnover rates (~25% per year) and is remodeled via surface osteoclasts and osteoblasts.
- **Basic Multicellular Unit (BMU)**: resorption is coupled to formation. Cortical bone the BMU is a cutting cone, in cancellous bone is occurs along osteoid seams and osteoclasts in Howship's lacunae.

### Bone Biopsy
- Typically, if a patient undergoes a bone biopsy a section of the iliac crest is taken under procedural and local sedation.
- Un-decalcified segments are prepared, and mineralization front is assessed. 
- Tetracycline labeling can be used to calculate rate of bone formation, helpful in low turnover bone diseases.

### Osteopetrosis
- "Marble bone disease"
- Autosomal recessive (more severe) and dominant inherited disorder with increased bone density
- Result from mutations in genes related to osteoclast formation and function, which result in failed osteoclast activity, retained primary bone and mineralized cartilage. Some known mutations include enzyme defects in osteoclast proton pumps or carbonic anhydrase, which are critical for making the acidic microenvironment needed to remodel bone.
- Bones become dense, sclerotic, and weak.
- Clinical manifestations: severe form in infancy with multiple fractures, anemia, hydrocephaly. Survivors may have cranial nerve deficits, hepatosplenomegaly, recurrent infections.
- Xray: Dense, poorly formed, misshapen bones
- Biopsy: Cortex present, but thicker than normal but coarse and irregular, consisting of woven bone because it hasn't undergone remodelling. Interior does not contain appropriate cancellous bone; rather, there is a lack of the medullary canal and retained primary spongiosa.
- Treatment: bone marrow transplant

### Defective Mineralization
- Most likely caused by underlying disorders which lead to low serum calcium. In these disorders, osteoblasts can make osteoid normally, there just isn't enough mineralization therefore bones become soft and weak.
- **Osteomalacia** - typically due to a Vitamin D deficiency in the adult, mature skeleton. Over time, more and more mineralized bone is replaced with unmineralized osteoid. Biopsy under microscope shows thick seams of pink, unmineralized osteoid. Can have subtle presentation, look for radiographic changes with loss of bone density and cortical thickness. Insufficiencies will lead to stress (Milkman) fractures, skeletal pain, and bony tenderness.
- **Rickets** - typically due to a Vitamin D deficiency in the growing child (3mo - 3yrs), developing skeleton.  Limb and pelvis deformities with a soft, thin skull, but affects all bones that undergo endochondral ossification (skull base, frontal and parietal bones). Defective longitudinal bone growth due to lack of provisional calcification zone. Masses of cartilage build up at the epiphyseal growth plate and osteoid continues to build up, contributing to a very irregular osteochondral junction. Example: rachitic rosary - bead like "bumps" on ribs that represents irregular osteochondral junctions.
- **Renal osteodystrophy** - renal failure. Common picture is hypocalcemic, hyperphosphatemic, hyper-parathyroidism. 
- **Hypophosphatemia** - renal tubular defect, inability to reabsorb phosphate from the urine
- **Hypophosphatasia** - uncommon genetic disorder of osteoblast alkaline phosphatase

### Osteitis Fibrosa (Cystica)
- Metabolic bon e disease in patients with (primary or secondary) hyperparathyroidism
- Increased level of parathyroid hormone (PTH) results in metabolic bone disease: How? Leads to osteoclast differentiation, osteoclast activation, increases in GM-CSF and RANKL, increased bone breakdown and calcium release, increased calcium resorption in the kidney tubules. 
- Pathology Overview: localized, lytic lesions, subperiosteal scalloping (removal of cortical bone due to increased osteoclast activity), diffuse demineralization
- Pathology in cortical bone: subperiosteal and endosteal resorption, thin cortices
- Pathology in cancellous bone: dissecting osteitis, marrow fibrosis microfractures, hemorrhage, diffuse demineralization. Discrete area of bone destruction can mimic bone tumor lead to a "brown tumor" of hyperparathyroidism, do not necessarily need to be removed.

### Pathology of bone tumors
- Bone tumors, group of proliferative lesions (both benign and malignant neoplasms) that have the ability to produce space-occupying mass lesions in the bone.
- Less dense on xray: **osteolytic** appearance; more dense (whiter) on xray: **osteoblastic**
- Locations of bone tumors: Bone tumors occupy characteristic locations, favor certain bones (axial vs. appendicular), and favor specific regions within the bone (epiphysis vs. metaphysis vs. diaphysis)
- Bone tumors are classified by type of tissue and behavior (what they're doing)
- **Benign neoplasms**: Osteogenic - osteoma or osteoid osteoma. Chondrogenic - *osteochondroma exotosis* (pedunculated growth), enchondroma. Fibrogenic - nonossifying fibroma. 
- **Malignant neoplasms**: Osteogenic - *osteosarcoma*.  Chondrogenic - chondrosarcoma. Fibrogenic - fibrosarcoma. Hematopoietic - *myeloma*, lymphoma. Neurogenic - *Ewing's sarcoma*, metastatic disease.
- **Osteosarcoma**: most common malignancy of bone after multiple myeloma. Osteoid producer. Bimodal distribution, 10s-20s and over 50s and can develop in Paget's. Common location: Metaphyseal region of the long bones, 50% at the knee. Clinical presentation: pain, enlarging mass, fracture. 
- **Ewing's sarcoma**: High grade malignancy, arising from primitive neuroectodermal origins. More common in young males. Most common in diaphysis and metaphysis of the extremities, but can also occur in the flat bones (scapula, pelvis, ribs). Presents with swelling, pain, and systemic symptoms, which might mimic osteomyelitis. Xray shows lytic bone lesions and sunburst or onion skin periosteal lesions.
- **Multiple myeloma**: Hematopoietic neoplasm of malignant plasma cells, most common primary bone tumor. Xray shows "punched out" lytic bone lesions due to neoplastic plasma cells producing RANKL which activates osteoclasts and DKK1 which inhibits osteoblasts. Labs show anemia and hypercalcemia.
- **Metastatic bone disease**: More frequent than primary bone tumors. Commonly arise from primary oncological processes in the prostate, breast, lung, thyroid, or kidney. Multiple vs. solitary metastasis has to be ruled out. Lytic vs. blastic vs. mixed. Can cause pathological fractures, pain, or neurological deficits.
