### Hyponatremia and Hypernatremia
- Common electrolyte disturbances that are more to do with *water* metabolism rather than sodium metabolism.
- The physiological stimulus for H<sub>2</sub>O is thirst, which is driven by increased serum osmolarity or decreased effective blood volume. Plasma osmolarity is correlated linearly with plasma ADH concentrations above osmolarity levels of 285 mosmol/kg; plasma ADH concentrations scale exponentially with percentage blood volume depletion.
- Water excretion is regulated by the kidneys; the major determinants are (a) effective arterial volume and (b) ADH status, which effects reabsorption of water in the collecting ducts.
- **ADH regulation**: Extracellular fluid volume (thus blood pressure) is by far the strongest stimulus, extracellular fluid osmolality is the other factor. When these two factors are in opposite directions, the volume stimulus overrides the osmotic stimulus.
