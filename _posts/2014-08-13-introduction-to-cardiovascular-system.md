### Molecules in Motion: The Physics of Life
- Cellular life is a complex chemical reaction that depends on the continuous motion of critical molecules.
- Critical molecules that are building blocks, energy substrates, and signaling molecules are under constant flux into work and waste products
- Homeostasis comes down to  regulation of the interstitial fluid, managed to be consistent with regards to chemical and physical properties, maintaining within narrow parameter windows for optimized functioning
- Regarding the model: Epithelial surfaces are the interface with the environment, capillary surfaces: 
- At rest, 5 L / min, but changes in metabolism will instruct the circulation to increase its work to meet those demands. "Circulation is slave to metabolism"

### Blood flow is continuously adjusted to match the rate of metabolism
- Flow that goes across the heart must match flow across the systemic circuit.
- Whole body flow demand is set by metabolism of the tissue space, and must be met by the cardiac output.
- Balance demand and supply!
- At flow equilibrium, flow supply = flow demand; flow matches metabolism
- Pump moves blood out of venous compartment into arterioles, likewise, arterioles allow blood to be drained from them at a metered rate.
- Cardiac pump: CO = HR x SV = average amount of flow (Q dot CO = dv/dt)
- Arteriolar resistance: Q dot system = delta P system / Resistance of arteriole (need pressure gradient to overcome resistance!)
- Resistance of arteriole is **INVERSELY** related to level of metabolism; thus, more metabolic demand, less arteriole resistance, thus greater Q dot sys.
- The next question is how does the pressure gradient arise (delta P sys)
- Causality: Displace volume, create pressure difference greater than resistance, flow occurs.
- Heart pumping moves the blood from venous to arteriolar compartments, thus pressure difference arises...


### Learning Objectives Review

1. Understand the central role of the circulation in homeostatic regulation of the internal environment
2. Explain the role of the circulation in homeostasis, differentiate between the
