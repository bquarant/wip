### Principles and Mechanisms
- The malignant transformation of a cell is grounded in the mutations in DNA that gives the cell: (a) growth preference, (b) angiogenesis, (c) ability to affect stroma, (d) ability to derail apoptosis, (e) ability to avoid immune detection.
- Chemotherapeutic agents have been developed to target one or more aspects of oncogenesis.
- Targets are increasingly more well defined as knowledge of genome and oncogenes increases

### The Hallmarks of Cancer - Hanahan and Weinberg
- Self-sufficiency in growth signals
- Insensitivity to anti-growth signals
- Apoptosis evasion
- Sustained angiogenesis
- Limitless replicative potential
- Tissue invasion and metastasis

<span><br></span>

### Development in molecular genetics in cancer
- **CD20** in lymphoma, **Bcr/abl** chimaera in CML, **Her2neu, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptors** in breast cancer, **braf** mutation in melanoma, **kras** mutation in colon cancer, **EGFR, alk** in lung cancer.
- For each of the above mutations, we now have a drug that targets either the receptor or the gene product.

### Systemic treatment of malignancy
- Chemotherapeutic agents initially in the 1940s. 
- Biologics: monoclonal antibodies, EGFR inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, VEGF inhibitors, immune modulators, proteasome inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors
- Major roadblock is **resistance**, which can be caused by mutation (amplification or deletion of targets), drug transport out of the cell, decreased cell entry, expression of alternate receptors.

### Basic principles of chemotherapy
- **More drugs usually better than less**: (for lymphoma, R-CHOP > CHOP > COP > C)
- **Use drugs with non-overlapping toxicities** 
- **Use drugs with different mechanisms of action**
- **Need to balance toxicity and efficacy**
- **Better use of supportive care**: anti-emetics, growth factor support

### Chemotherapy approaches
- **Neoadjuvant**: shrink a tumor before surgery, e.g. inflammatory breast cancer
- **Adjuvant**: used after surgery to improve survival
- **Multimodality**: in combination with surgery and radiation
- **Palliative**: for symptomatic treatment

### Chemotherapeutic classification
- **Alkylating agents**: *cyclophosphamide*, melphalan, chlorambucil. All have chloroethylamino structure (N-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-Cl), which forms a highly reactive carbonium ion that covalently links with reactive amines, oxygen, or phosphate on DNA. Leads to mis-pairing, ring opening, and crosslinking. Use to treat lymphoma, CLL, multiple myeloma breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and some autoimmune disorders. **p53** mutations lead to resistance to alkylating agents. *Toxicity*: to rapidly dividing cells of GI tract and bone marrow, leading to immune suppression and sterility.  **Secondary leukemogenesis**. Emetogenic.
- **Alkylating platinum agents**: *cisplatin*, carboplatin, oxaliplatin. **Mechanism**: agent ligand displaced by H<sub>2</sub>O, resulting in a highly-reactive positively charged molecule which attacks nucleophilic sites on DNA, leading to crosslinking. Cisplatin is very active in solid tumors, and has allowed the cure of advanced testicular cancers. Unique toxicities: emetogenic, nephrotoxic, neurotoxic (peripheral and hearing), hypo-Mg, hypo-K. Spares the bone marrow.
- **Antimetabolites**: methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine. Grouped into anti-folates and nucleoside analogs. Inhibit precursors of DNA. Bone marrow suppressing. S phase targets.
- **Anthracyclines**: doxorubicin, mitoxantrone. Fungal origin. **Mechanism**: intercalate with DNA to affect transcription and replication, complexing with topoisomerase II to promote apoptosis, generate free radical mediated DNA damage. Used to treat leukemias, lymphomas, breast cancer, osteogenic sarcoma. Unique toxicity in that it causes **cumulative cardiotoxicity** resulting in **CHF**.
- **Antimicrotuble drugs**: vinca alkaloids (vincristine), taxanes (paclitaxel). Work in M phase. Either prevent microtubule formation or prevent their disassembly.
- **Antitumor antibiotics**: bleomycin: used in treatment of testicular cancer. Causes oxidative damage to thymidylate deoxyribose in G2 as well as free radicals. Toxicity: pulmonary toxicity leading to respiratory failure and death.
- **Topoisomerase inhibitors**: irinotecan, topotecan, etoposide
- **Proteosome inhibitors**: bortezimib. Inhibits the proteasome, leads to apoptosis? Used only in multiple myeloma and lymphomas.

### Targeted therapies
-  "Designed to block the fundamental mutations that cause specific cancers"
- What are these mutations? Abnormal growth factor receptors, dysregulated intracellular signaling, defective DNA repair, deranged apoptosis, tumor angiogenesis. 
- Fall into two major categories: **monoclonal antibodies**, **tyrosine kinase inhibitors**
- **Monoclonal antibodies**. Bind to cell surface receptors that are expressed more. Fully human -umab, chimeric -ximab. Given intravenously. Targets currently available: EGFR receptor, VEGF receptor, CD receptor. 
- **Tyrosine kinase inhibitors** Work intracellularly, interfere with downstream messaging from EGFR, VEGR, Bcr/abl fusion gene product. Oral drug given at fixed dose.
- **VEGF receptor**: angiogenesis is critical for tumorigenesis. Now well established that tumors over-express VEGF, PDGF, and FGF. There is an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, which can be targeted by a TKI. VEGF binds with VEGFR, activating downstream enzymes responsible for angiogenesis, can be targeted with a mAb. Bevacizumab (Avastin): IV only, q2-3 weeks, indicated for renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, or wet macular degeneration. **Class effects**: vessel injury, bleeding, hypertension, proteinuria, arterial thrombotic events, GI perforation. No bone marrow suppression.
- **EGFR receptor**: family of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases. mAbs: cetuximab, trastuzumab. TKIs: erlotinib, gefitinib. **Class effects**: rash, anorexia, fatigue, infusion reactions. Trastuzumab has significant cardiotoxicity.
- **Immune Modulatory Analogs**: thalidomide, lenalidomide. Striking effects in multiple myeloma refractor to other treatments, now is standard of care. Lenalinomide is a second generation drug designed to avoid teratogenicity. **Mechanism**: direct anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effect, inhibits IL-6 and TNF production, anti-angiogenic, enhances immune reactivity through NK and T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. **Class effects**: peripheral neuropathy, somnolence, bone marrow suppression, birth defects. Oral drug, tight prescription control.
