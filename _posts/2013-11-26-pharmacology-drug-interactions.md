### Summation \(Additivity\)
- The effect of two drugs given simultaneously is equal to the sum of their individual effects.

<span><br></span> 
### Potentiation \(Synergism\)
- The effect of two drugs is greater than the sum of their individual effects

<span><br></span> 
### Antagonism
- The effect of two drugs is less than the sum of their individual effects

## Types of Antagonism
- Non-pharmacological or physical antagonism  
  - Activated charcoal for adsorption of a toxin  
  - Chelation of heavy metals
  - Opposing effects at distinct sites: (e.g. NE vs. histamine on blood pressure)
- Pharmacological antagonism 
  - Two drugs interact either *directly* or *indirectly* with a common receptor to produce a net diminished effect.
  - __agonist__: a drug which has affinity for a receptor, and intrinsic activity at that receptor
  - __antagonist__: a drug which has affinity for a receptor but has no intrinsic activity
  - Formation of the antagonist-receptor complex does not produce a pharmacological response
  - __surmountable antagonism__ - "reversible," "competitive" model
  - __insurmountable antagonism__ - formation of covalent bonds
