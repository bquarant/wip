### Anti-platelet agents
- Platelets provide the initial hemostatic plug at sites of vascular injury
- They also participate in pathologic thrombosis at the site of rupture plaque in coronary and carotid arteries
- The potent anti-platelet agents have allowed the deployment of arterial stents with low rates of re-thrombosis and have revolutionized treatment of CAD and PAD.
- Mainly used in **arterial** disease!

### Aspirin
- Salicylate ester of acetic acid
- **Mechanism of action**: prevents release of ADP and PF4 from platelets, preventing second phase aggregation. Major action though is to **inhibit COX**, thus preventing synthesis of Thromboxane A2, a potent platelet aggregator and vasoconstrictor, but also inhibits synthesis of prostacyclin which opposes Thromboxane A2 activity.
- Anti-platelet effect persists for the duration of the life of the platelet!
- Aspirin is rapidly absorbed if chewed, and comes in contact with platelets in portal circulation therefore doesn't need to reach plasma concentration levels to be effective. **Very low** doses (i.e. 81 mg) are effective for COX-1 inhibition. Other consequences of inhibited platelet activation include reduced cytokine release, decreased oxygen radical formation...
- **Clinical uses for aspirin**: decrease risk of TIA in patients with previous event, acute MI, unstable angina, secondary prevention of MI, hypercoaguable states, after thrombolysis, with coumadin in prosthetic valves. Maybe for primary prevention of MI in CAD?

### Clopidogrel (Plavix)
- Mechanism of action: **Inhibits ADP binding** to P2Y and P2X receptors. Also, prevents GPIIb/IIIa activation.
- Leads to irreversible inhibition of those receptors for the life of the platelet, so stop this medication early before procedures!
- Used after placement of stents, acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, or post-TIA. Indicated for primary therapy for aspirin allergic patients.
- Drug is given once daily orally, and there is extensive metabolization in the liver in order toreach active form. **Notes**: P450 inhibitor, use caution with phenytoin or NSAIDs.
- Clopidogrel resistance: requires good functioning of CYP2C19, functional variants of this enzyme lead to different effects on platelet activation; loss of CYP2C19 will mean that clopidogrel won't be efficacious because the active form won't form, whereas hyperactive CYP2C19 is associated with an increase in bleeding risk.
- Adverse effects: primary bleeding, rash, GI distress.
- **Black box warning**: Don't use PPI's and clopidogrel together; PPI inhibits CYP2C19 thus making less active clopidogrel available. 
- If patients really need to be on PPI concurrently, put them on **prasugrel**, which isn't metabolized through CYP2C19.

### Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibitors
- This class consists of monoclonal antibodies against the surface GpIIb/IIIa receptor for **fibrinogen**
- Several different agents (abciximab, eptifibatide), all bind reversibly with a high affinity.
- **When to use**: used primary pre- and post-PTCA in patients with ongoing cardiac ischemia refractory to aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin treatment.
- Bleeding time returns to normal in 12-24 hours after cessation, major adverse effect is bleeding and thrombocytopenia
- Contraindications: active bleeding, CNS pathology, uncontrolled hypertension, coagulopathy otherwise known
