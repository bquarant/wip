**Answer 2**:

## Overview of the Gastrointestinal tract
- The GI tract is formed from the endoderm and is divided early on into the foregut, midgut, and hindgut. Muscle and serosa layers originate from the lateral plate mesoderm.
- There are four histological layers surrounding the lumen: **mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa, and serosa or adventitia**
- Mucosa: formed from endoderm, has digestive, secretory, and absorptive functions. Forms the epithelium, which invaginates to form glands, but remember that epithelium does not have its own blood supply but rather relies on diffusion. The **lamina propria** is a layer of supportive connective tissue in the mucosa. **Muscularis mucosa** delineates the mucosa from the submucosa.
- Submucosa: supports the fragile mucosa with dense collagen fibers, bigger vessels, and nerve plexus.
- Muscularis externa: coupled layer of smooth muscle that contracts and push food through the lumen
- Serosa: another name for the visceral peritoneum, final protective barrier.
