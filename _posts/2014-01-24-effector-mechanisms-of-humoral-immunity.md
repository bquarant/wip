### Objectives
- To understand the effector mechanisms of antibodies in combating microbes.
- To differentiate the effector mechanisms of different antibody isotypes
- To understand mechanisms of microbial resistance to humoral immunity

### Immunoglobulin molecular biology
- Fab: short arm, antigen binding component, made up of light chain and heavy chain. Hypervariable region found here; antigen binding component made up of variable regions from heavy and light chains.
- Fc: log arm, "constant" fragment, determines antibody isotype (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, or IgE)
- Antibodies bind target antigen through Fab, and implement effector functions through Fc.
- Effector functions depend on isotype!

### Immunoglobulin effector functions
- Neutralization of microbe and toxins
- Opsonization and improvement of phagocytosis of microbes
- Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)
- Complement activation, leading to: (1) lysis of microbes (due to MAC complex), (2) phagocytosis of microbes opsonized with complement fragments (C3b, note analogy to Ab-mediated opsonization), and/or (3) inflammation (C3a-mediated)

### Antibody effector functions depend on isotype
- **IgG**: Neutralization of microbes and toxins, opsonization of antigens for phagocytosis, activation of classical complement pathway, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (mediated by NK cells), neonatal immunity (passive, half-life 23d), and feedback inhibition of B cell activation.
- **IgM**: Activation of the classical complement pathway.
- **IgA**: Mucosal immunity, neutralization of microbes and toxins, prevent uptake!
- **IgE**: Helminth defense, mast cell degranulation

### How antibodies work
- Antibodies function mainly in the extracellular arena.
- (A) Microbe entry though epithelial barrier: the antibody blocks penetration of microbe through epithelial barrier (IgA)
- (B) Infection of cell by microbe using cell-surface receptor: the antibody blocks microbe:receptor binding and thus intracellular infection
- (C) Release of microbes from infected cell and infection of adjacent cell: the antibody blocks infection of the adjacent cell
- (D) Pathologic effect of toxin: the antibody blocks binding of the toxin to the cellular receptor.
- IgG antibodies promote phagocytosis through the **Fc:Fc(gamma)R1** binding. The constant fragment of an IgG:microbe immune complex binds the macrophage, Fc receptor initiates signal cascade telling phagocyte to initiate phagocytosis.
- **Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity**: IgG promotes extracellular killing of antibody-coated target cells by NK cells through the **Fc(gamma)RIIIA** receptor, by means of the cytosolic ITAM domains. Remember you need +ITAM and -ITIM (i.e. loss of MHCI) in order to flip the kill switch.
- **IgE** antibody recognizes antigen on helminth, binds to the **Fc(epsilon)RI** receptor on eosinophils and mast cells, triggers degranulation and thus kills the helminth. Remember that Th2 cells stimulate eosinophils through the cytokine **IL-5**.

### Classical complement and the humoral immune system
- IgM or IgG binds antigen on microbial surface.
- C1 binds the Fc of IgG or IgM, becomes active. Remember that C1 is the product of C1r and C1q, and its formation can be inhibited by C1 inhibitor (see: CGD case)
- C1 triggers the complement cascade, forms C3 convertase and you're off to the races...
- Result: inflammation (due to anaphylatoxin), phagocytosis, MAC formation.

### Pathogen evasion of humoral immune defense systems
- **Antigenic variation**: e.g. viruses, HIV, flu  (antigenic drift), N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli
- **Inhibition of complement activation**: don't allow the C3 convertase to be formed...
- **Resistance to phagocytosis**

- Most existing vaccines work by inducing antibody responses!
