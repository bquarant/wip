### Inflammation Mediators
- Plasma: cascading enzyme systems (kinins, complement, coagulation factors)
- Cells: preformed elements, synthesized elements
- Mediators feature **redundancy**
- Mediators **amplify** the reaction. 
- Mediators have a **short** half life, and typically have **neutralizing** counterpart

<span><br></span>

### The Hageman Factor (Factor XII)
- "Fibrin plus platelets = blood clot"
- Collateral damage: activation of inflammation pathway can lead to thrombosis due to overlap of the pathways
- Fibrin-split products:
- **Kallikrein:** Factor XIIa activates pre-kallikrein into kallikrein, leading to splitting of HMWK into bradykinin, important mediator of pain. It also takes plasminogen to plasmin, which leads to fibrin and fibrin-split products. Be aware of **amplification**: kallikrein and plasmin leads to more factor XII activation and thus more of themselves.
- Kininase: inhibits bradykinin, thus limits pain and increased vascular permeability.
- Follow up: **slide 81**

### Complement System
- 20 proteins in plasma, activated during complement cascade
- Three activation pathways: classical, alternate, lectin (MBL)
- C1-C9 are the major players, key step is C3 activation.
- **C3a**: serum component, permeability, vascular dilation
- **C5a**: serum component, effects greater than C3a, chemotactic factor for PMNs, macrophages
- **C3b**: opsonin, coat bacteria to enhance phagocytosis
- **C5-C9**: MAC induces microbial or cell necrosis due to channel formation
- Deficiency of the the MAC lead to *Neisseria* infections. See flashcards on late complement defect.

### Clotting Cascade
- Begins with Factor XII (intrinsic) or tissue factor thromboplastin (extrinsic)
- Prothrombin converted to thrombin, this leads to fibrin from fibrinogen.
- Fibrin collects with platelets, leads to thrombosis.
- Fibrin can be broken down by plasmin, leading to fibrin-split products, which are also mediators.

### Pre-formed Cellular Factors
- **Vasoactive amines**: released by mast cells, basophils, or platelets. Induced by cell injury, IgE, C3a, or C5a. Actions are permeability and vasodilation. These bind to H1 receptors on the endothelium. Histamine causes the reorientation of W-P bodies.
- **Lysosomal constituents**: enzymes, mostly. Released from PMNs, the 'messy eaters.' Actions are tissue destruction and vascular permeability. Key components: phospholipase A2, myeloperoxidase.
- **Platelet activating factor**: source: mast cell, PMNs, macrophages, endothelium, platelets. It is a phosphocholine that is derived from phospholipid in cell membrane. Role: vasodilation, vascular permeability (100-100x more potent than histamine), WBC activation and chemotaxis, adhesion, promotes synthesis of other mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Inactivated by acylhydrolase.

### Synthesized Cellular Factors
- Prostaglandins & Leukotrienes
- Selective COX inhibitors.... **FOLLOW UP ON THIS**
- **COX 1**: occurs normally in many cell types, cyclooxygenase-1 is protective in the gastric mucosa.
- **COX 2**: induced, mainly in WBCs during inflammation. Basic 
- PGI2 or prostacyclin (endothelium) - vasodilator, decreases platelet aggregation
- PGE2 (macrophages) -  fever and pain
- Thromboxane (platelets): vasoconstrictor, increases platelet aggreation
- Leukotrienes: made by WBCs, most other cells lack 5-lipoxygenase. 5-lipoxygenase activated by FLAP.
- LTC4, LTD4, LTE4: vascular permeability
- LTB4: PMN chemotaxis
- **Cytokines**: follow up, page 104.
- **Chemokines**: made by lymphocytes, macrophages, and endothelium. Over 40 types, small, cysteine-containing. Direct leukocyte trafficking (chemotaxis) by gradient formation. Example: IL-8 gradient for PMNs.
- **Nitric Oxide**: produced by endothelium and macrophages. Produces vasodilation and vascular smooth muscle relaxation. Reduces WBC rolling and adhesion, therefore slows inflammatory response.

### Free Radicals
- Produced by lots of different ways: radiation, inflammation, oxygen toxicity, chemicals, reperfusion injury
- Single unpaired electron in outer orbit, highly unstable and reactive
- Especially attacks DNA!
- **Free radical damage**: lipid peroxidation of membrane, fragmentation of DNA (via binding to thymine), protein cross-linking (increases degradation)
- Management system: superoxide dismutase to move to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. ;
