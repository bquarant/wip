### Histology of the gastrointestinal tract
- The GI tract is the digestive tube, formed from embryonic endodermal tube divided into the foregut, midgut, and hindgut.
- The tube is located within the body cavity (tube within a tube), and is only open on the two ends. Musculature and blood vessels arise from lateral plate mesoderm.
- The function of the GI tract is to absorb foodstuffs and form solid waste.
