### Schizophrenic Disorders: Etiology
1. State concordance rates for schizophrenia for twins, parents, and siblings
* 40-50% concordance for MZ twins
* 9-10% concordance for DZ twins
* Family history in 1st degree relative = 10x higher risk c/w control
* Risk alleles also associated with other mental disorders

􏰁2. Discuss environmental factors that may lead to the development of schizophrenia
* Obstetric Complications: 2x more frequent, play role in early-onset
* Infections: prenatal (1st, 2nd trimester) infections with influenza, herpes, rubella, etc...
* Nutritional Factors: famine + malnutrition increases risk 2x
* Immune Factors: autoimune disorders associated with increased risk (d/t increased cytokines?)
* Cannabis Use: may contribute, especially in individuals with a positive family history (OR 2.2 - 2.8)
* Other Factors: immigration, advanced paternal age

􏰁3. State 3 different neurotransmitters and the role they may play in the schizophrenic illness
* Dopamine: positive symptoms due to overactivity of D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway, whereas negative and cognitive symptoms due to underactivity of D2 receptors in the mesocortical pathway. 
* Glumate: hypofunction of NMDA receptors may contribute (e.g. PCP, an NMDA antagonist, can cause psychotic symptoms)
* GABA: GABAergic interneurons appear dysfunctional
* Acetylcholine: not sure if Ach pathway is disrupted, but smoking cigarettes (nicotinic Ach agonist) is prevalent in schizophrenics


### Neuroscience of Psychosis
1. Name three drug discoveries that reveolutionized the understanding and treatment of mental illness
* Bromides - treated epileptics
* Penicillin - treated neurosyphilis
* Chlorpromazine - birth of the dopamine hypothesis 

2. Name two gross brain structural abnormalities in schizophrenia
* Decreased brain size, globally
* Increased ventricle size (ex vacuo ventriculomegaly)
* Decreased volumes of medial temporal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and parahippocampal gyrus. 

3. Label brain structures most involved in positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia
* Positive symptoms: "misinterpretation or misidentification of unfiltered sensory information" - temporal lobe and limbic system abnormalities
* Negative symptoms: "withdrawal from the sensory overload" -  posterior hippocampus, frontal lobe.

4. Illustrate the four dopamine pathways in the brain
* Mesolimbic
* Mesocortical
* Nigrostriatal
* Tuberoinfundibular

### Differential Diagnosis of Psychosis
1. Primary psychotic disorders
* Psychosis primary symptom, no other illness, medication, or substance on board.
* **Schizophrenia** - Must have two for more than six months: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, or negative symptoms + functional impairment
* **Brief Psychotic Diosrder**: s/o psychosis within 2 weeks, lasts less than 30 days, with or without stressor. Often significant emotional turmoil and affect shifting, major suicide risk. Functional return to baseline.
* **Delusional Disorder**: one or more delusions (fixed false beliefs held in spite of presented contrary evidence, specify if bizarre), without major impairment of psychosocial functioning. Types: erotomanic, grandiose, jealouse, persecutory, and somatic.
* **Schizoaffective Disorder**: concurrent symptoms of schizophrenia and a major mood disorder. Must be a period of two weeks where psychosis without mood symptoms, though mood symptoms prevail. Prognosis based on whether psychosis or mood symptoms predominate. 5% suicide risk. 


2. Other mental illnesses that may exhibit psychotic symptoms
* Psychosis in mood disorders: seen in severe depression and mania, "mood congruent" - delusions of persecution and depression, delusions of grandiosity and mania. Note: if psychosis is present, it's mania not hypomania.
* Psychosis in dementia: 30% of dementia have visual hallucinations, 30-40% have delusional thinking, beware of delirium on dementia.
* Psychosis in personality disorders: enduring, pervasive patterns of behaviors that deviate from cultural norms. Transient psychosis lasting minutes to house seen in paranoid, schizotypal, and borderline.
* Psychosis in delirium
* Psychosis in PTSD: hallucinations, paranoid ideation
* Psychosis in Post-partum Mood Disorder: usually delusions about the infant or command hallucinations therefore **psychiatric emergency**, may require inpatient hospitalization

3. Psychosis due to substance use
* Substance induced Psychotic disorder: hallucinations or delusions that are a physiologic effect of intoxication or withdrawal. Commonly in cocaine, cannabis, and hallucinogens.
* Delirium Tremens - delirium superimposed on withdrawal. Confusion, tactile and visual hallucinations, seizure.
* Medications - may occur as SAE at therapeutic dose (steroids, PD drugs) or with overdose. Highest risk are elderly and those with hepatorenal impairment. Beware of medication combinations inducing or suppressing metabolic pathways. Common classes of meds include: anticholinergics, antiparkinsonian agents, steroids, amphetamines, antihypertensives, antibiotics, muscle relaxants. 

4. Psychosis due to a general medical condition
* Trauma / CNS: head bleeds, tumors, seizures, migraines
* Autoimmune: MS, SLE
* Metabolic: uremia, hepatic encephalopathy, prophyrias, thiamine deficiency (pellagra), B12 deficiency
* Endocrine: hyperthyroidism, Cushing's
* Infection: HIV, sepsis, viral/bacterial encephalitis

### Psychopharmacology of Antipsychotics
* Distinguish between typical and atypical antispychotics
- Typical antipsychotics: D2 block > M1 block > alpha1 block > H1 block
- Mesolimbic D2 block reduces the positive symptoms of schizophrenia
- Mesocortical D2 block from medication may cause secondary dopamine deficiency and cognitive side effects
- Nigrostriatal D2 block leads to lack of inhibition of Ach release. Overactivity of Ach treated with anticholinergics 

* Compare and contrast the action of typical and atypical antipsychotics in each dopamine pathway
* List common side effects associated with the antipsychotics
- EPS (Extrapyramidal Symptoms): Drug-induced parkinsonism (tx: anticholinergic), akathisia (tx: beta block, benzo), dystonia (tx: anticholinergic IM), tardive dyskinesia
- Atypical: anti-cholinergic (drowsy, dry mouth, blurry vision, constipated, retention, confusion)

* Describe the clinical presentation of NMS and treatment options
* Distinguish between Clozaril and the other atypical antipyschotics
* Outline the effects of antipsychotics on the cardiac system
* Describe the relationship between antipsychotics and metabolic syndrome
