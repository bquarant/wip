### Review!
- Cancer is uncontrolled cell division and growth.
- Checkpoints ensure everything is OK before the cell moves into the next phase, M and S checkpoints.
- Cancer is a genetic and epigenetic disease.
- **Oncogenes**: gain-of-function mutations in proto-oncogenes
- **Tumor suppressors**: loss-of-function mutations or silencing. Generally need double hit in order to be effected.
- Cancer is a multi-hit phenomenon, but the minimum required amounts of hits is not known; could be hundreds. Today's lecture on colorectal cancer will focus on the "AK-53" sequence: First, there is an allelic loss on 5q affecting APC, then a deletion on 12p affecting K-ras, then loss of p53 tumor-suppressor gene. Additional mutations required for metastasis.
- Genomic and chromosomal instability is a major feature of cancer..."destabilization of the chromosome leads to acceleration of mutation rate."
- **Overview:** Hereditary colorectal cancer sheds light on sporadic cancer. DNA-based testing may lead to sensitive, non-invasive screens for sporadic cancer.

### Three major routes to colorectal cancer
- The major routes: Wnt signaling (*genetic*), microsatellite instability (*genetic*), or CpG island methylation phenotype (*epigenetic*)
- High penetrance, single-gene inheritance occurs in about 5% of cases. (Examples: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), APC I1307K, Peutz-Jegher, Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), juveline polyposis.)
- Sporadic, non-germ line cell mutations that occur over the lifetime of the individual, responsible for 80%
- Low penetrance, multiple gene inheritance in combination with environment account for remainder 15%

### Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) & Wnt-APC-Beta-catenin
- Gross appearance of resected colon lumen shows hundreds and hundreds of small polyps.
- Inheritance pattern: **autosomal dominant**, highly penetrant with 95% risk.
- Clinical course: early onset at 30-45 years.
- FAP is caused by mutation of the **APC** on chromosome 5. Linkage analysis in FAP families elucidated chromosome 5 breaks. The APC gene is a big gene and big protein, with 21 exons and 2845 amino acids. Most occur within exon 15 and result in protein truncation.
- Under normal circumstances and when no signal from Wnt, APC is phosphorylated and bound to a phosphorylated beta-catenin. Under these conditions, this leads to the degradation of beta-catenin. 
- Now, when Wnt binds FrzB, multiple steps leads to APC being dephosphorylated, leading to beta-catenin moving to the nucleus and acting as a transcription factor for multiple growth related genes.
- But what if you have an **APC** mutation? If you have a non-functional or no protein, beta-catenin is now present at all times even in the absence of Wnt signalign, whereas before it occurred only in highly regulated times and places.
- Having a truncated protein, i.e. APC1309, is known as a **dominant negative mutation**, and thus has higher penetrance. Having a complete loss of one allele of APC actually is lower penetrance. Having one allele that works is better than having one that works and one that's truncated.
- Turns out, APC has another function outside of Wnt signaling: cytokinesis. APC and beta-catenin is known to attached to the spindle microtubules, at the kinetochore, at the centrosome, and at cortical attachment sites. Bottom line: APC and beta-catenin interact with proteins needed for cytokinesis.
- Big problem occurs when the second hit occurs -- taking out your one functional APC gene leads to major tumor progression.
- **Most sporadic colorectal cancers** involve dysregulation and dysfunction of Wnt signaling pathways.

### Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) & Microsatellite Instability 
- Inheritance pattern: **Autosomal dominant**. Early onset at 45-55 years. Highly penetrant at ~70%. Tumors arise primarily in the proximal colon, and microsatellite instability.
- E. coli fixes DNA mismatches using methylated template strands. MutL, MutS, and MutH are endonucleases that cut the strand allowing for methyl-directed mismatch repair.
- HNPCC is caused by mutations in genes encoding the mismatch repair proteins. Not known completely how mismatch repair works in humans yet, though.
- Mismatch repair deficiency results in **microsatellite instability** because of the highly repetitive nature of microsatellites. Microsatellite instability manifests as either expansions or contractions of the microsatellite regions.
- Mismatch repair deficient cells increase mutations at **other genetic loci**. Axin2, a protein involved with sequestration of phosphorylated APC and beta-catenin, has a microsatellite. Thus, a mismatch repair deficiency could result in a problem in the Wnt signaling cascade.

### Transforming Growth Factor Beta - TGF-B signaling pathways
- TGF-B binding activates cytosolic serine/threonine kinase domain, which phosphorylates Smad2/3, which can translocate to the nucleus and effect gene expression.
- Uh oh! TGFBR-II gene contains a microsatellite; so in folks that have a mismatch repair deficiency has an increased likelihood of mutation and therefore increase

<span><br></span>

### CpG island methylation phenotype
- Methylation is a normal epigenetic regulatory event that controls (silences) gene expression
- Methylation is heritable from parent to daughter cell.
- Abnormal methylation found in many tumors, can contribute to cancer.
- CpG methylation of **MLH1** (mismatch repair): Active MLH1 is aberrantly methylated, which now puts the cell into mismatch repair deficiency. Now, Axin2 and TGFBR-II are possibly affected due to containing microsatellites.

### Sporadic Colorectal Cancer
- **Environmental factors**: spontaneous, chemical, UV light, radiation, viruses
- **Screening**: colonoscopy, barium enema, stool testing (FOBT, DNA via PCR)
- Goals for screening: sensitivity, early detection, and non-invasive. 
- Epigenetics and cancer: use methylation-specific PCR. Vimentin is used as a marker for methylation. Use bisulfite on DNA extract to convert cytosines to uracil, but 5-methylcytosine is resistant to this process. Methylated cytosine will remain **C** on your results, whereas if it was non-methylated it will be a **U**.
