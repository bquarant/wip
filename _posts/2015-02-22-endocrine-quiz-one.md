**Q:** The mechanism of action of hormones is affected by whether or not they are water soluble or relatively lipophilic
<br>
**A:** True. Hydrophilic hormones like proteins, peptides, and catecholamine do not pass through the cell membrane and thus exert their effects by transduction across the membrane. Conversely, hydrophobic or lipophilic molecules such as steroids, retinoids, and thyroid hormones can pass through the cell membrane and find their receptors located inside the cell.

**Q:** Hypothalamic and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus patients have a similar response to treatment with DDAVP.
<br>
**A:** False. Hypothalamic, or "central" diabetes inspidus is defined as loss of ADH secretion, whereas nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is defined as loss of responsiveness to secreted ADH. According to Dr. Brownie's Posterior Pituitary lecture, DDAVP gives a poor response in nephrogeneic DI compared with some response in central DI.

**Q:** ACTH and LH increase the rate of cholesterol side-chain cleavage in target tissues
<br>
**A:** True. OK, so cholesterol side-chain cleavage when I quickly search it is about p450 enzyme systems... OK. Turns out this is from Dr. Brownie's Anterior Pituitary lecture, from the tables that he skipped over and told us to just memorize them for the test. From the slides themselves: "ACTH stimulates glucocorticoid and androgen production by inner zones of the adrenal cortex through activation of cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P-450", and "LH Summary - Action -  activates cholesterol side-chain cleavage"

**Q:** Babies with congenital growth hormone deficiency (GHD) have normal birth weight and height
<br>
**A:** True. I recalled this fact from the lecture, because Dr. Bethin stressed the fact that intrauterine growth is growth hormone independent, and instead relies on IGF-2. The supporting evidence from this includes data that congenital GHD deficieny babies are of normal birth parameters, that anencephalic babies also often reach full birth length, and that babies born to hyperinsulinemic patients are larger than normal.

**Q:** Since most hormones circulate in blood at very low concentrations, a receptor must have:
<br>
A: Tissue specific expression
<br>
B: Binding specificity
<br>
C: Effector specificity --> this is true, but not what they're looking for IMO
<br>
**D: Very high affinity for the hormone** --> straight from slide 8/72, receptors "have very high affinities because hormones are at low concentrations"
<br>
E - An extracellular location

**Q:** MAP kinase activation by some protein hormones is preceded by acrtivation of Ras.
<br>
**A:** True. RTKs activate GRB2, which activates Ras. Ras is a small monomeric G protein anchored to the inner leaflet of the membrane, and can then activate MAP kinases (Raf, Mek, and Erk), which in turn phosphorylate transcription factors.

**Q:** Arginine infusion is one provocative test that is used by pediatric endocrinologists to investigate a child with acquired growth hormone deficiency
<br>
**A:** True. Testing for growth hormone deficiency requires a peak of less than 10 ng/ml on two growth hormone stimulation tests. The list of tests on slide 61/70 suggests you can use hypoglycemia, arginine, clonidine, L-dopa, glucagon, or exercise to elicit the growth hormone response. My current understanding of how this works is that they will all lower blood glucose, and GH will be secreted as a counter-regulatory hormone to balance out this change.

**Q:**  Which of the following parts of the pancreas does not develop from the dorsal pancreatic bud?
<br>
A: Tail
<br>
B: Body
<br>
**C: Uncinate Process** - "Embryology â€“ The pancreas is formed by two buds, namely the dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds, originating from the endodermal lining of the duodenum. When the duodenum rotates to the right, the ventral pancreatic bud moves dorsally. It comes to lie immediately inferior and posterior to the dorsal bud. Later the parenchyma and duct systems fuse. *Thus the uncinate process and part of the head of the pancreas are formed by the ventral bud.* The remaining part of the head, the body and tail are formed by the dorsal bud."
<br>
D: Top part of head
<br>
E: Neck

**Q:**  ACTH has some melanotropic effect and this is presumably related to alpha-MSH
<br>
**A:**  By way of review, ATCH is a 39-amino acid peptide which is processed from a larger precursor molecule called pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). There's two basic amino acids bookending the ATCH residues, which tells the enzymes where to cut. The first 13 amino acids of ACTH can be further processed to alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone. MC1-R is the principal melanocortin receptor in the skin where is regulates pigmentation, and has affinity for both ACTH and alpha-MSH. 

**Q:**  ADH action on the kidney to increase water reabsorption is mediated by decreased recruitment of aquaporin 2 channels to apical membranes of principal cells.
<br>
**A:** True. By way of review, AVP activates the V2 receptor of principle cells in the collecting ducts and tubules. The alpha subunit of the V2 GPCR then activates adenylate cyclase, which increases cAMP and PKA action. Downstream effects include CREB induced transcription of AQP2, which leads to increased water reabsorption.

**Q:** IGF-1 suppresses GH secretion, both directly  (on somatotrophs) and also indirectly, by increasing somatostatin and suppressing GHRH.
<br>
**A:** True. There are three paths by which IGF-1 suppresses GH secretion, and this statement covers them all.

**Q:**  Pulsatile secretion of hormones is essential for long-term physiological regulation of a neuroendocrine axis.
<br>
**A:** Very true. From the notes - "The knowledge of pulsatile behavior is important for understanding disease mechanisms. Most, but not all, physiological changes and changes during disease states are modulated via pulse mass rather than pulse frequency. Clearly, pulse frequency is of utmost importance for the functioning of the gonadotropic axis. The study of pulsatile behavior in disease state will determine the future role for pharmaceuticals and microdevices that allow for modification of pulsatile hormone secretion."

**Q:**  Hormones such as thyroxine and cortisol have their major effects in the body by activating which of the following processes?
<br>
A: Glucose entry into cells
<br>
**B: Transcription of genes** - Thyroxine and cortisol are both lipophilic hormones, which exert their effects primarily through alteration of gene transcription.
<br>
C: Bile secretion
<br>
D: DNA replication
<br>
E: Nerve conduction.

**Q:** Nuclear hormone receptors:
<br>
A: Are transcription factors
<br>
B: Cause alterations in nucleosome structure
<br>
C: Recruit coactivators or corepressors
<br>
D: Have highly conservered DNA binding domains
<br>
**E: All of the above are true** -- this appears to be the most logical answer, as A through D are all very good answers.

**Q:** The second messenger generated following activation of phospholipase C is cyclic AMP.
<br>
**A:** False. Phospholipase C is activated through the G<sub>qa</sub> pathway, which then cleaves PIP2 into IP3 and DAG.

**Q**: In subjects that have a plasma osmolality of 298 mosm/Kg, the response of the pituitary is to secrete increased amounts of ADH.
<br>
**A**: The normal human reference range for plasma osmolality is 285-295 mosm/Kg. This suggests that the the subject is slightly hyperosmolar, which will be detected by hypothalamic osmoreceptors which will in turn secrete ADH and lead to water reabsorption from the collecting system of the kidney. Other potent stimulators of ADH secretion are stretch receptors; loss of 15% to 20% blood volume leads to the highest ADH concentrations.

**Q:** The hormones of the posterior pituitary are synthesized in the cell bodies of the magnocellular neurons in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei.
<br>
**A:** True. This is just a statement of fact. ADH and oxytocin, the two hormones of the posterior pituitary, are made in their respective hypothalamic nuclei and transported to the posterior pituitary via axoplasmic flow.

**Q:** Hormones that exert their action by activating adenylate cyclase
<br>
**A:** D: Require GDP to dissociate from the stimulatory G-protein.

**Q:** Peptide hormone assays used in endocrinology take advantage of the unique chemistry of the peptide bond in different peptides
<br>
**A:** False. I was a little bit hung up on this one, thinking that they were referring somehow unique combinations of peptide bonds, which is the basis for antibody specificity in ELISA assays, but, when I looked through the notes on peptide hormone assay, I found this: "Is there anything 'special' about the chemistry of the peptide? The answer is a big NO."

**Q:** Hormones secreted by the kidney include calcitriol, EPO, and angiotensin II
<br>
**A:** False. The kidney secretes the first two and renin. Lung is responsible for angiotensin.

**Q:** Hormones such as thyroxine and cortisol have longer half-lives than hormones such as glucagon or insulin
<br>
**A:** True. In general, lipophilic hormones have longer half-lives than water-soluble hormones.

**Q**: An increase of calcium into endocrine cells results in increased secretion of hormones such as GH and ACTH.
<br>
**A:** True, calcium signal is required for both GH and ACTH. Reviewing the pathway, neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus secretes CRH, which binds to receptors in corticotrophs and activates adenyl cyclase and PKA. PKA activates L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which increases intracellular calcium concentration and then the release of ACTH. ACTH in turn increases cortisol secretion. Cortisol then exerts negative feedback at both the hypothalamus and pituitary.

**Q:** Androgens are produced from estrogens in both the testes and ovaries.
<br>
**A:** False. This has the relationship backwards. Androgens are C19 compounds and include testosterone, 5alpha-dihydrotesterone, and DHEA. Estrogens are C18 compounds, and estradiol is the most important one.

**Q:** Identify the single incorrect statement concerning the use of indirect measurements that enable us to diagnose endocrinopathies:
<br>
**A: Insulin assays provide much better information than glucose tolerance tests especially when one is dealing with diabetes mellitus type 2** Selecting this option, because insulin assays are typically not done, at least to my knowledge.
<br>
B: Serum calcium assay is critical for the detection of hyperparathyroidism and complements any data you may receive on plasma levels of parathyroid hormone
<br>
C: Plasma renin activity levels are used along with aldosterone assays to differentiate primary aldosteronism from renovascular hypertension
<br>
D: The finding of hypokalemia and / or hyponatremia directs you to further evaluate hypertenisve patients

**Q:** Hypothalamic and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus have plasma ADH levels within the same range
<br>
**A:** False.
