### Principles of Hematopathology
- **Morphology**: Diagnosis of lymphoma or leukemia requires histopathologic examination of lymph nodes, bone marrow, peripheral blood, or other involved tissues. Requires either peripheral blood smear or biopsy of some sort.
- **Lymphocyte development**: most lymphoid malignancies resemble some recognizable stage of B or T cell development.
- **Lymphocyte migration and function**: malignant lymphocytes tend to recapitulate the behavior of their normal counterparts.
- **Clonality**: lymphoid malignancies are considered "clonal"
- **Classification and diagnosis**: based upon morphology, immunophenotype, genetic and molecular characteristics, and behavior.

### Lymphoid Organs
- **Primary/Central**: cells of the blood and immune system originate in the bone marrow from hematopoietic stem cells, lymphocytes either develop in the bone marrow (B-cells) or in the thymus (T-cells) up until the stage where they're able to perform their function in response to antigens. At that time, they migrate via blood and lymphatic system to guard the peripheral tissues. 
- **Secondary/Peripheral**: lymphoid tissues where antigen-specific reactions occur, all share the same basic architecture and way of responding to antigens. *Lymph nodes*, all throughout body, process antigens, *Spleen*, red vs. white pulp, *MALT* (*GALT* vs. *BALT*). Rich in dendritic cells which trap antigen and present it to lymphocytes, initiating and maintaing the adaptive immune response. 
- **Overview of Lymph Node architecture**: Cortex has a B-zone and T-zone. B-zone characterized by follicles or germinal centers, where B cells undergo intense proliferation after specific antigen stimulation with the help of a follicular dendritic cell. The T-zone, or paracortex, is characterized by predominance of T-cells, interdigitating dendritic cells, and high endothelial venules which allow lymphocytes to migrate through. The medulla of the lymph node contains plasma cells, which secrete antibodies. Sinuses have histiocytes, which can take up and process antigen.

### Antigen Independent Differentiation
- Occurs in the primary lymphoid organs **without exposure to antigen**.
- Produces a pool of lymphocytes capable of responding to an antigen.
- Stages: 1. Stem cell, 2. lymphoblast, 3. naive (virgin) B or T cell with antigen receptor rearrangement.
- Gene rearrangement overview: lymphocytes express surface antigen receptor proteins that allow them to recognize specific antigens; B-cells use immunoglobulin molecules with heavy and light chains, T-cells use TCRs. Both have **constant** and **variable** regions, and each developing lymphocyte generates a unique antigen receptor by rearranging its receptor gene segments, and if successful then only expressed **only one specificity**.

### B-cell Development
- Stage 1 - **Stem cell / Pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell**: primitive, has cell surface markers *TdT* and *CD34*, neoplasm at this stage causes undifferentiated acute leukemia.
- Stage 2 - **Precursor B-cells** - (Pro-B, Pre-B, immature B): these cells are found in the bone marrow. Markers early include *CD19*, *TdT*, *CD34*, late markers include *CD10*, *IgM*, *CD20* sequentially as maturation occurs. Neoplasms at this stage are B-lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma.
- Stage 3 - **Naive B cells** - these cells are small, resting lymphocytes that circulate in the blood in order to comprise the majority of B cells found in the primary follicles and mantle zones of the germinal center. Markers include *CD19*, *CD20*, but will lack TdT and CD10. Immunoglobulin genes are rearranged, but unmuted, and normally would be committed to expression of a single kappa or lambda light chain. Neoplasms at this stage include mantle cell lymphoma
- Stage 4 - **Activation** -- activated B-cells proliferate at the border of the T and B cell regions, and differentiate into immunoblasts or plasmablasts. Neoplasm at this stage includes IgM plasmacytoma (Waldenstroms macroglobinulemia). Activated B cells then migrate to primary follicles and proliferate to form germinal centers. Neoplasm at this stage would be a follicular lymphoma. Centrocytes / centroblasts are cells that have undergone the germinal center events. Normal germinal centers exhibit "zonation" in that there is a darker area and a lighter area.
- **Somatic Mutations of Immunoglobulin Genes**: B-cells undergo several important modifications in the germinal center, one of which is somatic mutations leading to altering of the immunoglobulin V-region gene, altering and ideally improving the affinity for the antibody for the antigen. *Result is marked intra-clonal diversity of antibody combining sites, despite only a few precursors*. Immunoglobulin somatic gene mutation serves as a marker for cells that have experienced the germinal center. Surviving centrocytes have increased affinity, and go on to become either memory B-cells or immunoglobulin secreting plasma cells.
- **Follicular lymphoma**: tumors of the germinal center B cells due to failure of apoptosis. This occurs because of a chromosomal rearrangement, **t(14;18)** that leads to increased expression of **Bcl-2**, an anti-apoptotic factor. 
- **Plasma cells**: plasma cells leave the germinal center and enter the lymph node medulla or can travel to the bone marrow. Related neoplasms: *plasma cell myeloma*, *plasmacytoma*

### T-cell Development
- T-cells originate in the bone marrow, but all of the important events of development occur in the **thymus**.
- Most immature T stem cells arrive in the subcapsular region of the thymus as immature CD3<sup>-</sup>4<sup>-</sup>8<sup>-</sup> cells. As they go through the thymic cortex, they become "double positive" CD3<sup>+</sup>4<sup>+</sup>8<sup>+</sup>. As they move from cortex to the medulla, they also express less TdT ("marker of immaturity").
- Neoplasms that can develop: T lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia or peripheral T-cell or NK-cell lymphoma or leukemias.

### Diagnosing Lymphoid Malignancies
- Diagnosis may be difficult, and there are lot of special tests to confirm diagnosis, assist in classification, and to detect minimal residual disease.
- **Lymph Node Biopsy**: always send fresh, do these early in the day! Normal study is morphologic, but ancillary studies include immunologic markers and genetic rearrangement studies.
- **Lymphoid Markers**: concept is that lymphomas are derived from lymphocytes that are "frozen" at some stage of development. Ideally, classification of lymphoma is based on the normal counterpart, but lymphocyte development is not entirely understood and neoplasia doesn't always play by the rules...
- **Clonality**: If clonality can be confirmed, then the process is virtually assured to be *malignant*. B-lymphoid malignancies are confirmed by determining that the abnormal lymphocytes express only a single light chain (kappa or lambda), called light chain restriction. Harder to evaluate clonality in T-cells.
- See below: kappa stains brown, lambda stains red. Mixture of colors (left pane) means there's polyclonal plasma cells. Uniformity in color (right pane), means that there is a monoclonal population, which is virtually assured to be malignant.
- **What if you can't conclusively tell what the lymph node is?** - Proceed to *antigen receptor gene rearrangement* test. As the lymphocytes develop, the DNA undergoes rearrangement to result in the formation of functional immunoglobulin or TCR genes. Following gene rearrangement, the configuration of DNA in that lymphocyte is unique, and marks the cell and its descendants.
