### PT and aPTT
- **PT (Prothrombin Time)**: Usually referred to using the International Normalized Ratio, INR. Blood is drawn into a blue-top tube, which citrates the blood and binds calcium. Without the calcium, blood clotting can't occur. Plasma is then separated from the cellular component, and there are **no** platelets involved in this tests. Re-calcified citrated plasma is then exposed to thromboplastin, and a machine measures how long it takes for a clot to form and drop out. PT is measured in seconds, normal is 11-15, normal INR is 1.0. PT is a screening test for the **intact extrinsic pathway** (i.e. Factor VII) and the common pathway. Abnormal PT means either extrinsic or common pathway abnormality is present. Normal is very fast! **Elevated PT/INR**: Factor VII deficiency, Factor VII inhibitor, early liver disease, **coumadin** use in therapeutic dosage. **False elevation**: bad draw, hemoconcentration, hyper-Ig.
- **aPTT (Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time)**: screening test for the **intrinsic pathway**, measures all but Factor VII and TFIII. Also drawn in a blue top, then spun, then re-calcified plasma with contact activator (kaolin) and source of phospholipid, which acts as a surface for clot generation. Much slower, takes between 25-35 seconds normally. **Elevated PTT alone**: Factor XII, XI, IX, or VIII deficiency. Therapeutic dosing of heparin or contamination by heparin. Lupus coagulant (see later).
- **Elevation of both PT/PTT**: implies involvement of both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. **Consider**: severe liver disease, coumadin or heparin excess, DIC, severe vitamin K deficiency, common pathway factor deficiency (fibrinogen, thrombin, V, or X.)
- What to do when you get a PT/PTT you didn't expect: #1 - Make sure it's a good catch. #2 - Make sure there's no heparin in the sample. #3 - TALK to the patient!!! Check for history of bleeding disorder or any medications. #4 - Do a mixing study. If it corrects the problem, check individual factor assays.
