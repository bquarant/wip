### Overview of Thrombosis
- Venous disease kills >200,000 Americans yearly.
- Leading cause of death related to childbirth, 69 per 100,000
- 2 million Americans annually with embolic disease.
- **Virchow's Triad**: predisposition with stasis, vessel wall damage, hypercoagulability of blood.
- What causes stasis? CHF, CVA, immobility, hyperviscous, obesity, post-operatively, pregnancy.
- What causes vessel damage? Atheromatous changes in coronary and carotid arteries, thrombophlebitis of the veins in the lower extremities, vasculitis with microthrombotic changes.
- What causes hypercoaguability? Predisposition to pathologic thrombosis, may be inherited or acquired. HIT, DIC, TTP, hematologic malignancies

### Overview of Anticoagulation
- There is a natural anticoagulation system, components are:
- **#1 - Protein C pathway (with protein S)**: Inhibitors of Factor Va and Factor VIIIa. There are Protein C and Protein S deficiencies. Both are vitamin K dependent. How does it get activated? Thrombin activates thrombomodulin, which activates protein C. Functions to prevent more thrombin from being generated. Enhances fibrinolysis.
- Activated Protein C Resistance - AKA - Factor V Leiden: Point mutation in Factor Va makes it less susceptible to cleavage by APC, therefore more activation of thrombin, thus more susceptible to thrombosis. Accounts for 20-40% of patients with thrombosis. Most common cause of thrombophilia!
- Prothrombin G20210A: second most common cause of inherited thrombophilia, accounts for 10% of recurrent thrombosis. Leads to increased plasma prothrombin level.
- **#2 - Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI)**
- **#3 - Antithrombin III**: Direct inactivation of Factors XI, IX, Xa, and II. Potentiated by heparin (see anticoagulation lecture). Autosomal dominant deficiency, presents as recurrent venous thromboses.
- **#4 - Fibrinolytic system**: Rare disorders.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome
- Acquired prothrombotic condition, characterized by venous or arterial thrombosis OR pregnancy loss, in the presence of lab evidence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Auto-antibodies to B2 glycoprotein I, anticardiolipin AB, or lupus coagulant. Can also bind protein C, S, or prothrombin. One of the few conditions that presents with either venous **or** arterial thrombosis.
- Test using mixing study PTT - if it's a factor deficiency, mixing will correct; but, if it's APLS it won't correct because the antibody will continue to neutralize.
