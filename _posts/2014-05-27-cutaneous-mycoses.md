### Cutaneous Infections
- **Dermatophyte infections**: "ringworm" or "tinea". 3 genus, 40 species. Asexual reproduction by hyphae fragmentation. Epidemiology: exposure is common, source is mostly human. Anthrospores or fragments are attached to shed skin cells and prolong viability in the environment. Anyone can become infected, but often requires local trauma or immune suppression (primarily T-cell). Pathogenesis: **Metabolize keratin**. Involves epidermis, rarely involves dermis. Colonization triggers local inflammatory response. T-cell immunity required; antibody not raised. May see unusual appearance if steroids on board. Diagnosis: Use KOH prep after scraping for hyphae. Treatment: use an azole or allylamine/benzylamine. Do not use nystatin or an antifungal/steroid combination!   

- **Tinea capitis**: scaling of the scalp with erythema and inflammation, generally in children. Damage ot the hair shaft with hair loss. "Black dot" due to shaft breaking flush with the skin. Human to human spread and fomite mechanism possible. KOH prep of the hair follicles shows diffuse anthrospores. Untreated infection can lead to allopecia or kerion formation. Requires oral (systemic) treatment.

- **Tinea pedis**: Acute: pruritic, vesicular, erythema, "Athlete's Foot," or chronic. May have associated hand, nail, or groin lesions and may be self-infecting. Topical prescription is usually adequate, but patients often have already treated before presentation.

- **Tinea corporis**: Pruritic, circular/oval, erythematous, scaling patch or plaque, classic "ringworm". Spreads centrifugally. Has central clearing which may initially be concerning for Lyme, but erythematous, scaling, advancing ring. Treat with topical or oral prescription.

- **Tinea cruris**: Jock itch, tinea corporis of the inguinal fold. *T. rubrum* looks like "christmas lights" May spread extensively, but may spare the scrotum. Topical prescription is adequate.

- **Onychomycosis**: Affects the toes or fingers, usually starts at the corner of the great toe and spreads to the cuticle but involves the nail bed. Usually caused by dermatophytes, but lesions on fingers have increased risk of *Candida*. Requires prolonged oral prescription with terbinafine, so you need to confirm diagnosis before authorization will be granted!

- **Candidal Intertrigo**: Erythematous, macerated plaques or erosions. Increased risk with obesity, diabetes, antibiotics, steroids, chemotherapy, or restrictive clothing. Common sites are gluteal, inframammary, infrapannicular, inguinal, and interdigital. Usually caused by *C. albicans*, topical prescription and use nystatin with a drying agent applied at a different time.

- **Malessezia**: Common commensal skin dimorphic fungi. 3 groups of infections: Tinea (pityriasis) veriscolor - upper body scaly lesions, usually the opposite color of the patient's skin, treat with ketoconazole; seborrheic dermatitis: "seborrhea" - scalp, face, and trunk.

### Subcutaneous Infections
- **Sporothrichosis**: *Sporothrix schenckii*, dimorphic widespread environmental fungus but seen after outdoor vocation/avocation. "Cigar" shaped yeasts. Papule at site of inoculation, usually an extremity, spreading via lymphatics without significant pain or systemic symptoms. More widespread disease in patients with alcoholism, DM, COPD, AIDS. Culture definitive diagnosis important. Treatment requires a prolonged course of oral itraconazole and localized hyperthermia.

- **Eumycetoma**: Widespread distribution in soil, but more cases in tropics. Inoculation of conidia via splinter, thorn, etc. on the extremity. Starts growing as a subcutaneous nodule; tumor, sinus tract, granules. Can spread to fascia and bone and become chronic and disfiguring. Diagnosis: KOH prep, culture at room temperature. Treatment: prolonged (24 months) of an azole, sometimes surgical debridement required.

### Skin manifestations of invasive fungi
- Organ systems or disseminated infections sometimes have skin lesions
- **Dimorphic fungi** Histoplasma, blastomyces, coccidioides
- **Cryptococcus neoformans**
- **Opportunists**: C. albicans, aspergillus

### Quick Antifungal Cram Course
- Fungi have sterols (ergosterol) in cell wall, whereas humans have cholesterol.

- Classes of anti-fungal medications: **(1) Polyenes**: Nystatin (topical), Amphotericin B (IV). Mechanism: Bind ergosterol in cell wall pores. **(2) Azoles**: Many (ketoconazole, xyzazole) â€“ topical, oral, IV. Mechanism: Block conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. **(3) Allylamines/Benzylamines**: Terbinafine (also oral), naftifine, butenafine. Mechanism: Inhibit squalene epoxidase (depletes ergosterol)

- Griseofulvin: Binds tubulin, inhibits microtubule formation and therefore mitosis. Effective, but most have moved on to the azoles due to increased potency and decreased toxicity.3
