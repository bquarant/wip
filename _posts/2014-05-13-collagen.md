### Lecture Objectives
1. State the three types of inherited diseases illustrated by collagen
2. Describe the clinical features of Osteogenesis Imperfecta
3. Explain how mutations which result in abnormal collagen chains lead to more severe clinical symptoms than synthesis defects
4. Explain how Osteogenesis Imperfecta defects illustrate the mechanisms for autosomal dominant traits
5. Describe the clinical features of Ehlers Danlos syndrome
6. Explain how EDS illustrates inherited diseases due to defective protein processing
7. Explain how defects in a processing enzyme can lead to the same clinical symptoms as an abnormal structure of the protein modified by the enzyme
8. Explain why EDS is often autosomal recessive, but can be autosomal dominant
9. Describe the defect in the most common types of EDS (I&II) and the normal role of type V collagen
10. State the abnormality in keloid
11. State the role of fibrillin in elastic fiber assembly and Marfan's disease

### Overview of Collagen
- Collagen, of course, is a **super star** and its amazing variety of structures and functions are obviously related to genetics, the cross-linking of fibrils and fibers, and carbohydrate attachments.
- "The University of Collagen Diseases": What can we learn from collagen and its related diseases? Dominant traits, protein processing defects, families of related diseases with similar signs and symptoms but with variable severity.
- **Collagen Assembly**: start with a single chain of collagen as a polyproline helix, need **three** normal chains to make a functioning collagen molecule. For Type 1 collagen, which makes up 90% of the collagen in our bones, skin, and ligaments, you need 2 x <span><code>α<sub>1</sub></code></span> and 1 x <span><code>α<sub>2</sub></code></span>. These three chains are supercoiled and stabilized with hydrogen bonding and glycine residues allowing for close interactions. The resulting triple helix is called **tropocollagen fibril**; procollagen is the intracellular precursor molecule which retains terminal globular domains which require cleavage. Each tropocollagen molecule overlaps 4 other tropocollagen molecules, and at the overlap there are are cross-links.
- Tendon and cornea fibers are merely collagen fibers woven differently; the number and specific positions of the cross-links and carbohydrates determine these structural properties.

### Primary Structure of Collagen
- The fundamental unity of collagen is three long polyproline chains, each of about 1000 amino acid length
- Every third position is a <span><code>Gly</code></span> residue, with high internal homology.
- 25% of collagen 1 is <span><code>Pro</code></span> or <span><code>OH-Pro</code></span> residue which allow hydrogen bonding through a water bridge, also frequent is <span><code>Ala</code></span>
- Lysine (<span><code>Lys</code></span>) residues are also important, they can be hydroxylated and used for cross-links or carbohydrate attachment sites; <span><code>Lys</code></span> residues can also be oxidized to an aldehyde where they can function in cross-linking.

### Collagen Processing
- **Intracellular processing:**
1. Some <span><code>Pro</code></span> residues are converted to <span><code>OH-Pro</code></span> via **protocollagen hydroxylase** using cofactors Fe<sup>2+</sup> and ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Nutritional deficiency of vitamin C leads manifests as scurvy.
2. Procollagen is formed inside the cell and then secreted; but first, in the RER a signal peptide must be cleaved by a specific **peptidase**
3. Some <span><code>Lys</code></span> residues also are hydroxylated but by **lysine hydroxylase** which also uses ascorbic acid as a cofactor. Once hydroxylated, transferases in the RER and Golgi add function-specific carbohydrate residues. Deficiencies in lysine hydroxylase manifest as EDS Type VI (ocular).
- **Extracellular processing:**
4. Globular domains from the ends of the procollagen molecule are cleaved by **N,C-procollagen proteinases** into tropocollagen
5. Lysine residues are oxidized into lysal aldehyde by **lysyl oxidase** using Cu<sup>2+</sup> as a cofactor for cross-linking

### Collagen Processing: Clinically Significant Facts
- Processing is co-translational
- Rate is critical: The gene for <span><code>α<sub>1</sub></code></span> chains is transcribed twice as fast as the gene for <span><code>α<sub>2</sub></code></span>; resulting in the 2:1 ratio needed for Type I collagen.
- Procollagen folding beings **after** the complete chains are synthesized, and is regulated by chaperone proteins.
- Folding of procollagen begins at the C-terminal globular domain and proceeds toward the N  terminal; the triple helix forms like a closing zipper, so a "single broken tooth of the zipper" disrupts the triple helix N-terminal to the site of the problem. Thus, mutations towards closer to the C-terminal half of the protein are more serious than those towards the N-terminal.
- In fact, only mutations at <span><code>Gly</code></span> residues in the first 20% of the N-terminal sequence are non-fatal
- Cross-linking between tropocollagen molecules only happens outside the cell, and only when the globular domains have been digested away.

### Inherited Diseases of Collagen
- Almost all inherited diseases of collagen are **autosomal**, but there is one gene for collagen on the X chromosome, which leads to Alport syndrome (see: renal module, hereditary nephritis with hearing loss and ocular symptoms, due to Type IV collagen defect).
- Disease severity: can be fatal (prenatal, perinatally, or in the adult), moderate to severe, or mild.
- Two major categories: **Osteogenesis Imperfecta** - brittle bone disease, **Ehlers Danlos syndromes**: either affecting the skin (fragility, hyperextensibility) or joints (hypermobility).
