### Agents for Hepatitis B
- Remember cccDNA - covalent, closed circle of DNA has to be translated. Goes through P protein (polymerase) and RNA intermediate. Hepatitis B is closer to a retrovirus!
- DNA is translocated to the nucleus, where it is found in the cccDNA structure
- Pregenome RNA is translated at low efficiency to produce a 90 kDa polymerase protein P, which possesses reverse transcriptase activity.
- Before the completion of +âˆ’strand synthesis, core particles mature and these structures acquire envelopes by budding into the ER, where viral morphogenesis is completed.
- Progeny-enveloped virions are released from the cell by exocytosis or are recycled to the nucleus, where the process is repeated. 
- Chronic hepatitis B: Most people are HBe Ag positive, small amount of DNA, ALT normal, normal liver biopsy. But, there's a large group of HBe Ag positive, large amount of DNA, ALT elevated, and cirrhosis. Need to treat those!
- **Lamivudine**: MOA - inhibits HBV DNA polymerase in hepatitis B and reverse transcriptase in HIV by chain termination. SNPs of the polymerase gene lead to resistance. Rash is major SAE but low toxicity. 
- **Adefovir**: Can be used for lamivudine resistant viruses. Another nucleoside agent. SAE include calcium dysregulation, renal dysfunction
- **Entecavir** and **Telbivudine**: Guanosine and thymidine analogue, respectively. Very potent activity against at HBV with low rate of viral resistance, but no anti-HIV activity. Resistance conferred by SNPs
- **Tenofovir**: first approved nucleotide agent. Activity against HIV and HBV. Highly active against many of the RT mutants generated by other treatment regimens.
- Patient with HIV and HBV, both are detectable in serum. Pick three new drugs, but don't cover HBV appropriately then you will develop very angry wild type hepatitis virus...

### Agents for Hepatitis C
- Life cycle: "The cleavage of the polyprotein by viral and host-cell proteases yields structural viral proteins (core protein and envelope proteins E1 and E2) and nonstructural viral proteins (NS2 through NS5B), with a number of putative activities and functions."  
- Goal of therapy: control viral replication. Chronic therapy is oral with or without subcutaneous medications
- Success is influenced by the genotype of the HCV.  Predominant forms in the USA, 1a and 1b, are less responsive to therapy. Europe has more 2 and 3, which are somewhat easier to treat.
- Virological responses using PEG-ylated interferon and ribavirin are either non-response, sustained viral response, or SVR to relapse.
- First choice therapy: PEG-ylated IFN + Ribavirin. Soon: Direct-acting agents.
- **Interferon alpha**: triggers interferon-induced effector proteins on the exposed cell.  Mechanism: binds to IFN receptors, leads to dimerization and activation of Jak1 and Tyk2, which activate the STAT1 and STAT2 pathways. Hundreds of genes are up and down regulated; very non-specific response with complex interactions of many components of the immune system. No mechanism of resistance. Wide range of activity as anti- RNA- or DNA-viruses. Has to be given parenterally, either IM or **Sub Q**. PEG-ylation makes it once weekly dosing, improving outcomes. Adverse reactions: acute flu-like illness, thrombocytopenia, bone marrow suppression, neurological symptoms, AST/ALT increases. Response to IFN is genotype-specific, has demographic variability, and can be predicted with IL-28B polymorphism.
- **Ribavirin**: Mechanism not fully defined, but not a direct acting agent. Mechanism of resistance is unclear. SAEs: bone marrow toxicity, hemolysis, aerosolized problems. Use with IFN for Hepatitis C, aerosolized for RSV, or for Lassa or Hanta.
- **Sofosbuvir**: NS5B RNA polymerase inhibitor (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase). Devoid of side effects, extremely effective.
- **Telaprevir**: Protease inhibitor. Oral, three times daily with high fat for absorption. Major SAE: rash, anemia. 
- **Boceprevir**: Protease inhibitor. 4 week lead in before starting drug, marked alteration of taste (dysgusia)
- **Simeprevir**: Protease inhibitor. Once daily, but expensive. 
- **Miravirsen**: microRNA anti-sense against miR-122, works against entire transcript of HCV RNA.
