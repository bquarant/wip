### What reverses inflammation?
- eNO reduces rolling and adhesion
- IL-10 inhibits TNF, gamma-interferon, IL-2, and IL-3
- Neutrophilic **pyrin**: stops IL-1 production. How? Typically, a protein complex called the inflammasome activates proteases like Caspase-1, which activates IL-1. Pyrin blocks caspase-1 activation, thus preventing IL-1 activation.
- **Lipoxins** from lipo-oxygenase pathway: derived from arachidonic acid, most made from LTA<sub>4</sub>, but sometimes can be pro-inflammatory. Functions by inhibiting leukotriene synthesis, reducing WBC adhesion, and PMN chemotaxis

### Anti-inflammatory drugs
- **Antihistamines**: diphenhydramine
- **Antibodies** to adhesion molecules: natalizumab, anti-alpha4-integrin. Clinical trials ongoing for use in multiple sclerosis
- **Antibodies to complement**: eculizumab, anti-C5 antibody, inhibits MAC formation
- **Anti-TNF agents**: etanercept, blocks TNF, used in rheumatoid arthritis
- **Anti-purine signaling**: clopidogrel, inhibits platelets P2X/Y receptors.
- **Corticosteroids**: block arachidonic acid synthesis, modulate phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> activity
- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)**: inhibit COX-1 and/or COX-2.
- **Anti-leukotriene drugs**: 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, FLAP inhibitors, leukotriene receptor antagonists (montelukast).

### Inflammation - Morphology and Temporality
- **Acute, short-duration**: PMNs predominate, with classic signs of inflammation (rubor, calor...). Histological samples showing acute inflammation show lots and lots of PMNs, sometimes with identifiable macrophages. *Outcomes*: optimally: resolution or repair, less optimally: scar formation (fibrosis), other possibilities: abscess formation, chronic inflammation.
- **Subacute-intermediate duration**: polymorphous, mixed infiltrate with granulation tissue (see next lecture!). Histological samples showing subacute inflammation have a more diverse mixture of PMNs, lymphocytes, and macrophages. 
- **Chronic or long-duration**: no PMNs, no rubor, no calor. More advanced healing with collagen. Mediated by CD34:L-selectin and VCAM-1:VLA4 interactions of endothelial cell and leukocytes.
- **Chronic granulomatous inflammation**: localized reaction that replaces normal tissues. Epithelioid and giant cells present. Necrosis +/-. Causes: delayed hypersensitivity, foreign material, TB, fungus, syphilis, sutures
- **Granuloma**: macrophages fuse, forming giant cells. Mediated by IL-4 secreted by T<sub>H</sub>2 cells. Causes E-cadherin surface expression. Collagen!
- Inflammation is a series of overlapping steps!

### Inflammation - Exudates
- **Serous**: watery, often just transudate. Example: bister
- **Effusion**: serous fluid in a body cavity. Example: pleural effusion causing egophony
- **Catarrhal**: water plus mucus. Example: rhinorrhea in the setting of viral upper respiratory process
- **Fibrinous**: fibrin on surfaces. Example: pericarditis
- **Purulent**: thick, cellular exudate. Example: abscess
- **Hemorrhagic**: vascular involvement
- **Pseudomembranous**: sheets of dead cells and PMNs. Example: pseudomembranous colitis is pathognomonic for C. Diff.

### Lymphadenitis
- Tissue is drained by lymphatic vessels to the lymph nodes
- Inflammation may be combination of inflammatory cells plus organisms!
- Lymph node may have hyperplasia of follicles
- **Net result**: enlargement of lymph node, lymphadenopathy

### Laboratory Evaluation of Inflammation
- Increased PMN concentration is called **leukocytosis**, mediated by TNF and IL-1 which leads to increased production and release from the bone marrow. 
- Normal WBC is 5,000 - 11,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>
- Get a WBC differential count if there is clinical suspicion for inflammation or if leukocytosis prsent
- Left shift: more immature cells (bandemia) than mature cells
- **Lymphocytic leukocytosis**: signifies a chronic inflammatory process. (Consider viral disease, tuberculosis)
- **Eosinophilic leukocytosis**: signifies parasitic infection or allergic reaction
- **ESR and CRP**: see below
- **Procalcitonin (PCT)**: rises in inflammation and bacterial infection

### Acute Phase Reactants
- Host of proteins rise in the serum in response to inflammation or injury
- Many of these proteins are made in the **liver**, some of them are opsonins.
- Include: **fibrinogen, globulins, CRP, SAA**
- Quantify to monitor for resolution of inflammatory process or development of chronic inflammation
- **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)**: measures how far RBCs fall per hour. Normal range is up to 20mm/hr. Increased rate by fibrinogen or globulin in serum which would be seen in inflammatory processes due to stimulation of acute phase reactants. Decreased rate with anemias due to abnormal erythrocytes.
- **C-reactive protein (CRP)**: increased hepatic production of CRP triggered by IL-6. Peak CRP in 4-6 hours after acute-phase stimulation, remains elevated but falls in 7 days. Quantify with immunoassay. Elevated CRP found in post-operative recovery, acute MI, infections, and inflammatory disease.
