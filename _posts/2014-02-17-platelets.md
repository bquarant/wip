### Hemostasis and platelet overview
- Hemostasis it a delicate balance of pro-coagulant and anti-coagulant mechanisms. 
- 5 major components: platelets, coagulation factors, coagulation inhibitors, fibrinolysis, and blood vessels.
- Platelets provide cell-based platform for hemostasis, **primary hemostasis**.
- Platelets are made in the bone marrow by cytoplasmic fragmentation of megakaryocytes.
- Major regulator of protein production is **thrombopoietin**
- Normal: platelet count 150-400x10<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>. Lifespan 7-10 days. 1/3 sequestered in the spleen, proportion increases with splenomegaly.
- Platelet structural regions: peripheral (responsible for pseudopod formation), sol-gel zone (cytoskeletal elements), organelle zone (alpha granules, dense granules, lysosomes, mitochondria), membrane system (calcium storage, prostaglandin synthesis enzymes, canalicular system for surface area expansion during activation)

### Platelet ultrastructure
- **Surface glycoproteins**: GpIa/IIa: bind exposed collagen, GpIb: bind VWF, GpIIbIIIa-fibrinogen receptor, VWF attachment. 
- **Membrane phospholipids**: X--XA, II--IIa
- **Platelet surface antigens**: HPA, ABO, MHCI
- **Platelet interior** - dense granules (ADP/ATP, serotonin), alpha granules (PDGF, fibrinogen, B-thromboglobulin, heparin antagonist, Factor V, vWF), lysosomes, peroxisomes

<span><br></span>

### Normal platelet function
- Adhere to exposed collagen and vWF (IBE of collagen or vWF receptor leads to hemophilia!)
- Activate and change shape
- Secretion and degranulation from dense and alpha granules
- Thromboxane A2 generation
- Further aggregation, leading to a platelet plug!
- Site for thrombin generation through specific surface receptors: Factor V, XI, VII, VIII, vWF, Xa, IXa

### von Willebrand Factor (vWF)
- vWF is a large, complex, multimeric molecule, synthesized by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes.
- Stored in endothelial cells and platelet alpha granules.
- vWF function is dependent on multimeric composition and ability to undergo a structural transition from globular to filamentous. With vessel damage, exposed collagen rich matrix binds globular vWF and undergoes structural transition; foces expose hidden platelet binding sites and capture platelets to the damaged vessel. 
- **von Willebrand's disease** - decreased amount or function of vWF, disorder of primary hemostasis.
- **Glanzmann's thrombocytopenia** - inherited deficiency of GpIIbIIIa
- **Storage Pool disease** - no alpha granules!
- **Bernard Soulier syndrome** - deficiency of GpIb.
- These four conditions are all disorders affecting **primary hemostasis**!

### Acquired platelet dysfunction
- Drug effects (most common is aspirin): Aspirin - irreversible COX inhibition, prevents thromboxane generation. GpIIbIIIa inhibitors prevents platelet cross-linking. Clopidogrel: prevents ADP binding.
- Uremia (chronic kidney disease)
- Hyperglobulinemia (multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia)
- Myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic disease
- Thrombotic-thrombocytopenic purpura: abnormal vWF multimers

<span><br></span>

### Tests of platelet function
- Bleeding time: apply blood pressure cuff to 40, make small incision, time how long it bleeds. Normal is 3-8 minutes.
- PF100
- Platelet aggregation studies: ADP, collagen, ristocetin, arachidonic acid, adrenaline
- Flow cytometry: look for glycoprotein defects!

### Quantitative platelet abnormalities
- **Drug induced**: "almost any drug can cause thrombocytopenia"
- **Bone marrow failure**: any bone marrow failure picture may result in thrombocytopenia
- **Increased consumption**: due to immune processes in the periphery, DIC, or TTP
- **Sequestration**: rule out hepatosplenomegaly
- **Dilutional / Loss**: frank vs. occult bleeds

<span><br></span>

### Consumptive platelet disorders
- **ITP** - immune thrombocytopenic purpura: mechanism: auto-IgG antibody against platelets, usually against glycoprotein IIbIIIa. Platelets removed by RE system, especially Fc receptors in spleen. Primary (idiopathic) vs secondary; can be associated with lymphoproliferative diseases, infections especially viral, medications, transfusion, or auto-immune disease like SLE. Platelet counts often really low, e.g. sub-10k. There may also be a thrombopoietin deficiency! Pediatric ITP usually triggered by viral illness, usually presents with purpura, remits spontaneously, rarely recurs or becomes chronic. Adult ITP is not the same! Presentation is also with petechiae and purpura, bleeding less than degree of thrombocytopenia suggests, PLT sub-10k, bone marrow normal maybe with increase in megakaryocytes. Adult ITP is idiopathic in 50%, rarely remits spontaneously, and is much more difficult to treat, often becomes chronic, and often relapses. Association with *H. pylori*, so if you treat the bug you'll clear the ITP, probably due to a cross-reacting antibody. **Treatment**: suppress production of antibody with PO or IV steroids, then IVIG, then anti-D rhogam. Second line: splenectomy, rituximab (anti-CD20 agonist), thrombopoietin receptor agonists (eltrompopag or romiplastin).
- **TTP** - thrombotic-thrombocytopenic purpura. Regulation of vWF multimeric size is mediated by plasma metalloprotease ADAMTS-13, which recognizes and cleaves vWF when it is unraveled by shear forces of flowing blood. ADAMTS-13 deficiency or anti-ADAMTS 13 antibodies results in unwanted platelet aggregation in the high shear-force environment of the microvasculature, causing thrombocytopenia but also life threatening thromboses in the brain, lung, and kidney. Familial, or acquired. Rarely drug induced.  Can be relapsing. *Presentation*: purpura, jaundice, anemia, neurologic symptoms (confusion, dizziness, seizure, coma), microangiopathic hemolytic anemia due to  *Labs*: PLT low, BT high, ADAMST-13 activity usually less than 5% of normal, schistocytes from shear force against thrombosis, LDH up, bilirubin up, reticulocytosis, **BUT, COAGULATION TEST NORMAL!** *Treatment*: plasmapheresis with plasma-exchange to remove problematic immunoglobulin, then use immunosuppression (either prednisone or rituximab). Transfusion medicine: use **FFP**, which should contain some soluble ADAMTS-13. Recombinant ADAMTS-13 coming soon!

- **DIC** - disseminated intravascular coagulation: "severe bleeding and clotting" - widespread activation of the coagulation cascade, resulting in intravascular formation of fibrin and ultimately thrombosis of the vessels; however, the consumption of the coagulation proteins will also simultaneously lead to severe bleeding! *Causes*: sepsis, trauma, metastatic cancer, obstetric causes, toxin, transplant rejection, transfusion mismatch. *Pathenogenesis*: formation of fibrin via extrinsic pathway, defects in physiologic anticoagulation, increased cytokine release, impaired fibrinolysis. *Labs*: elevated PT and PTT, schistocytes, reticulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, but elevated d-dimer!. *Treatment*: fix underlying cause, replace coagulation factors, fibrinogen replacement by cryoprecipitate, low dose heparin, APC infusion!
- **HIT** - heparin induced thrombocytopenia - "unwanted platelet activation" antibody-mediated adverse effect of heparin; if severe you will be hypercoaguable with 30x risk of thrombosis! HIT antibodies activate platelets intravascularly, platelets then release procoagulants and lead to thrombin generation. *Presentation*: patient on heparin presents with falling PLT or clinical presentation consistent with thrombosis. **4 T's** - **T**hrombocytopenia (50%), **t**hrombosis, **t**iming (5-10 days after exposure), absence of o**T**her explanation. Treatment: stop heparin, start another anticoagulant (but not warfarin), test for presence of antibodies.
- **HUS** - hemolytic uremic syndrome
- **HELLP** - hemolysis with elevated LFTs and Low Platelets
