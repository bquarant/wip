### Overview of the Liver
- Largest parenchymal (specific tissue of gland or organ) organ in the body, 1500g.
- Four lobes: right lobe larger than left lobe, these are split by the falciform ligament. Quadrate lobe in anterior to the caudate lobe.
- Glisson's capsule: protective layer underneath the layer of peritoneum that surrounds most of the liver (except the bare area).
- Porta hepatis: site of vessel and duct entry and exit to/from the liver. Hepatic portal vein, hepatic artery enter. Bilary duct system exits the liver towards the small intestine.
- **Major functions**: protein synthesis (produces most of the circulating plasma proteins), detoxification (drugs and toxins), storage (vitamins and ions), metabolism (carbohydrate, fat, and protein), bile production and excretion, modifies hormone structure and function.

### Liver embryology
- The liver is a diverticulum of the foregut (endodermal derivation), and develops into a sheet of mesenchyme called the septum transversum. Septum transversum anteriorly becomes part of the diaphragm, but the rest of it becomes the ventral mesentery. The liver divides the ventral mesentery into two parts, thus you get the falciform ligament anteriorly and the lesser omentum posteriorly.
- Vessel embryology: vitelline vessels drain the yolk sac, but go on to form the sinusoids in the liver. They then keep getting bigger and bigger, crosslinking, and ultimately become part of the hepatic portal vein. The left umbilical vein, which carries oxygenated blood from the mother, contributes to a shunt around the liver due to contributions from the liver sinusoids called the ductus venosus. After birth, the child's liver has to do it's own work, and the ductus venosus becomes the ligamentum venosum.

### Porto-systemic anastomoses & intra-hepatic circulation
- Hepatic portal vein's major contributions are from the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein. The inferior mesenteric vein does also drain into the hepatic portal vein, but by way of the splenic vein.
- Periumbilical vein (portal) - superficial epigastric vein (systemic). Pathology: caput medusa
- Superior rectal vein (portal) - middle/inferior rectal vein (systemic). Pathology: internal hemorrhoids
- Left gastric vein (portal) - esophageal vein (systemic). Pathology: esophageal varices
- Intra-hepatic circulation: Hepatic portal vein brings 70% of the blood to the liver, hepatic artery brings 30% (but oxygenated) blood. Both hepatic portal vein and hepatic artery branch! Drainage back to IVC is via hepatic vein after passing through the sinusoids.
