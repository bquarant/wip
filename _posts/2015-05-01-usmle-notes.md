**Embryology / Neurology ** - pp. 444 - 446
-  Neural development: Starting around day 18, the notochord induces the overlying ectoderm to differentiate into neuroectoderm and form the neral plate. The neural plate subsequently folds into a tube, giving rise to neural tube and neural crest cells. The notochord cells become the nucleus pulposus of the intervetebral discs in adults. The neural plate can be subdivided into alar or dorsal plate, giving rise to sensory components; and basal or ventral plate which gives rise to motor neurons.
- The neuroectoderm further differentiates into CNS neurons, oligodendroglia, and astrocytes. The neural crest cells become peripheral nervous system neurons and schwann cells.  Microglia, because they are in the macrophage lineage, originate from mesoderm.
- The neuroectoderm initially forms three primary vesicles, the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. The forebrain further differentiates into a telencephalon and diencephalon, which develop into the cerebral hemispheres and thalamus, respectively. The midbrain remains the midbrain throughout development. The hindbrain develops into the metencephalon, which becomes the pons and cerebellum, and the myelencephalon, which becomes the medulla.
- Neural tube defects: "failure of the neuropores to fuse during the 4th week," leads to a persistent connection between the fetal spinal cord and amniotic cavity. Leads to elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in amniotic fluid and maternal serum. Increased acetylcholinesterase in amniotic fluid (confirmatory). Associated with low folic acid intake before conception and in early pregnancy.- Quick review of folic acid (B9) - function is to be converted to tetrahydrofolate (THF), which is a coenzyme for 1-carbon transfer/methylation reactions and also for synthesis of nitrogenous bases in DNA/RNA.  B9 deficiency p/w macrocytic, megaloblastic anemia with hypersegmented PMNs, glossitis, but no neurological symptoms. Labs show **increased homocysteine, normal methylmalonate** levels.
-Quick review of alpha-fetoprotein: AFP is a major plasma protein produced by the yolk sac and the liver during fetal development. It is thought to be teh fetal form of *serum albumin*. AFP binds copper, nickel, fatty acids, and bilirubin.
- ** Spina bifida occulta ** - failure of the bony spinal canal to close but without structural herniation. Dura is intact, but there is often an associated tuft of hair or skin dimple at the level of the defect.
- **Meningocele** - Meninges herniate through the defect, but the spinal cord remains in place. Normal AFP levels.
- ** Meningomyelocele ** - Both meninges and spinal cord are through the defect.
- ** Anencephaly ** - malformation of the anterior neural tube, resulting in no forebrain and an open calvarium. **Increased AFP** due to fetal:amniotic connection. **Polyhydramnios** due to a lack of a swallowing center in brain. Associated with maternal type 1 diabetes.
- ** Holoprosencephaly ** - Sonic hedgehog signaling defect leads to failure of left and right hemispheres to separate. Moderate form is cleft lip / palate, most severe form is cyclopia. Risk factors include toxins, gestational diabetes, ToRCHeS, first trimester bleeding, and history of miscarriage. Finally went back to Ostrow's slides, and yes indeed - he highlighted how the left and right hemispheres fail to separate and become one (holo) forebrain (prosencephalon). Quite interesting.
- ** Porencephaly ** - This is when the ventricle communicates with the amnion; I was getting this and holoprosencephaly confused; and not to be confused with hydraencephaly. Porencephalies are due to the fetal CVAs, now it all makes sense.
- ** Lissencephaly / Agyria / Pachygyria ** - due to failure of migration from germinal centers.
- ** Chiari II (Arnold-Chiari) malformation **: Significant herniation of the cerebellar tonsils and vermis through the foramen magnum, leading to aqueductal stenosis and hydrocephalus. Often associated with lumbosacral meningomyelocele and paralysis below the defect.
- ** Dandy-Walker**: Agenesis of the cerebellar vermis with cystic enlargment of the 4th ventricle, also associated with hydrocephalus and spina bifida. (SEE: assets/chiari-vs-dandy.png).
- ** Syringomyelia ** - cystic cavity within the spinal cord. Crossing anterior spinal commissural fibers are damaged first, resulting in bilateral pain and temperature sensation loss in the upper extermities. Associated with a **Chiari I malformation**, which are congenital 3-5 mm cerebellar tonsillar ectopia, usually asymptomatic until development of headache and cerebellar symptoms.
- ** Hydromyelia ** - this just like hydrocephalus but of the spinal cord. Central canal is lined by ependymal cells, if occluded, fluid build up causes distension and neurological symptoms.
- ** Diastematomyelia ** - split spinal cord due to congenital bony abnormality.
- **Tongue embryology*: 1st and 2nd branchial arches form anterior 2/3 of tongue, thus sensation and pain through V3, taste through VII. 3rd and 4th branchial arches form posterior 1/3, thus sensensation and taste through IX, except in extreme posterior where it is through X. Taste is processed thus by VII, IX, and X through the solitary nucleus. Motor innervation through CN XII, hypohlossal.
** Anatomy & Physiology / Neurology ** - pp. 447 - 459.
- This section starts off with the major cells and their features, which is all pretty basic information.
- Schwann vs. oligodendrocytes: Schwann cells are only myelinating 1 PNS axon, and need to know Schwann cells are of neural crest origin. Note that **acoustic neuromas** as CN VIII schwannomas, and if bilateral think NF2.
- #review - ** Sensory Corpuscles** - I'd like to see these in histologic section, as well as connected to the graph of their pathways...
- **Peripheral nerve histology**: inner most container is the endoneurium, which is where you'll find the inflammatory infiltrate in Guillan-Barre Syndrome. Next is perineurium, which controls permeability and needs to be rejoined in limb reattachment microsurgery. The epineurium  is the outer-most container of the nerve bundle and contains blood vessels and connective tissue.
- **Blood-Brain Barrier**: formed by three structures - tight junctions between non-fenestrated endothelial cells, the basement membrane, and astrocyte foot processes. Glucose and AA's cross slowly by carrier-mediated transport, but nonpolar / lipid-soluble substances cross quickly by diffusion. Notable exceptions are the **area postrema**, which is a small protuberance at the inferoposterior limit of the fourth ventricle which functions to detect toxins in the blood or CSF and act as a vomit-inducing center. Also, the **OVLT or vascular organ of lamina terminalis**, located in the anterioventral third ventricle (AV3V) region, and is important in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance by controlling thirst, sodium excretion, blood volume regulation, and ADH secretion. This neurons project to the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei to regulate ADH-secreting neurons in the posterior pituitary.
- #review - Thalamic and Hypothalamic Nuclei ... this needs to be printed out / moved to Notability so that I can mark it up / draw connections....
- **Sleep physiology** - suprachiasmatic hypothalamic nuclei releases norepinephrine, which stimulates the pineal gland to release melatonin.
