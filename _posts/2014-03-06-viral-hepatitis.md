### Overview of Hepatitis
- "hepa" (Gk.) = liver + "itis" = inflammation
- **Causes**: viral, alcohol, fat, medications, toxins, autoimmune
- **Viral**: A, B, C, D, E, G, etc. (EBV or CMV)
- **NYS epidemiology**: chronic C >> chronic B >> acute B > acute A > acute C
- Pathogenesis and "why we worry": Exposure to viral hepatitis leads to infection, which in the majority of cases proceeds to resolve spontaneously. In acute phase hepatitis, symptoms and signs of liver disease are common, and resolution is generally without sequelae. In a small amount of cases, infection leads to chronic infection (**definition: 6 months of infection**), which can lead to scarring or cirrhosis, liver failure, and death. In chronic infection, few symptoms or signs are present until cirrhosis is present. Rarely, some cases of acute infection go directly on to fulminant liver failure and death without the chronic phase.

### Hepatitis A
- Picornaviridae, RNA virus
- Aliases: infectious hepatitis, acute catarrhal jaundice, campaign jaundice, epidemic jaundice
- Prevalence: Highest prevalence in developing countries and BRICs. Accounts for 20-40% of viral hepatitis in US, despite being uncommon in WNY. NHANES seroprevalence 34% overall, 10% at age 5, 75% at age 50.
- Incidence: falling exponentially since 1997, peak of ~30,000 cases yearly, now less than ~2,500.
- Transmission: enteric, fecal-oral
- Risk factors: poor hygiene, crowded conditions, sewage
- Risk populations: Low SES, MSM, military recruits, children in day care
- Clinical course: Incubation period of about 30 days, usually mild course, resolves spontaneously, no chronic phase.
- Diagnosis: serum antibodies against viral proteins - **Anti-HAV** IgM - recent infection (onset to 12 months), IgG - remote infection (persists for years). Liver biopsy not needed.
- Prognosis: 1-2 weeks of symptoms if symptoms develop, 99% resolve spontaneously, less than 1% death from fulminant liver failure
- Treatment: no specific treatment. Rest as needed. Observe for clinical deterioration. Consider preventive measures, such as hygiene or vaccinations. Vaccination requires 2 doses but confers life-long protection.

### Hepatitis B
- Hepadnaviridae, **DNA** virus, can insert into human genome
- Prevalence: Global - 300 million infected, 1 million deaths per year. US - 1.2 million infected, mostly immigrant Asians. Dramatic decline recently in acute hepatitis B due to universal vaccination.
- Incidence: decreasing linearly since 1986. Peak incidence 25,000 cases per year now less than 5,000 cases per year. Again, safe sex practices and vaccination have influenced this curve the most.
- Transmission: blood and bodily fluids. Peri-natal transmission #1 globally, but sexual transmission is #1 in the US.
- Risk factors: immigrants from endemic areas (Asia, Africa), IVDA, MSM, sexual promiscuity, transfusion medicine, health care workers, developmentally delayed.
- Clinical course: incubation period of about 90 days, majority asymptomatic, symptoms more common in adults than children. Patients improve in 1-3 weeks; 95% will recover, 5% will develop chronic hepatitis B, and 1% will die.
- Diagnosis: **HBV core antigen**: only found in liver tissue and thus stain for this if you get a liver biopsy. **HBV surface antigen HBsAg**: abundant in the serum, "Australia Antigen" (AuAg), indicative of an ongoing infection. You can also measure antibodies against viral proteins, but remember that you won't have both at the same time! Core antibodies (anti-HBc) or surface antibodies (anti-HBs). IgM vs. IgG. Surface antibodies could mean past infection or past vaccination. You also want to see if the **'e' antigen (HBeAg)**  is present, because that is a much more aggressive infection. Be aware that there are mutants that affect this test.  **Gold standard**: HBV DNA by PCR, correlates with outcomes, finds mutant viruses, and good for monitoring treatment. Genotyping getting more common, 8 known, Hepatits B<sub>C</sub> genotype more aggressive, but true clinical significance is yet unknown.
- **Immune tolerant phase**: Typically seen in Asians infected at birth, they have high levels of viral DNA and are HBsAg+ and HBeAg+. Despite this, there is little liver injury, liver tests are normal, and there are no symptoms. How? Immune system tolerates the virus.
- **Immune clearance phase**: Typically seen in Westerners infected as adults. Immune system attacks infected cells, leading to LFT increase and symptoms. Inflammation leads to viral clearance or cirrhosis.
- **Quiescent phase**: Nearly normal liver enzymes, but low HBV DNA, HBsAg+, HBeAG-, anti-HBe +. May have multiple "flares" of activity but can be chronically healthy carriers.
- **HBV cccDNA**: covalent, closed, circular DNA that maintains chronic infection by being stable and persistent in the hepatocyte nucleus. In order to get rid of this cccDNA, the cell itself needs to die!
- Treatment: Acute phase: no treatment! Chronic: interferon, but now there's more dramatic medications: lamivuidine, adefovir, entecavir, tenofovir, telbivudine. Problem is expense and development of resistance.
- Prevention: avoid exposure to blood and bodily fluids, pre-exposure prophylaxis with recombinant HBsAg vaccine. Post-exposure prophylaxis with HBIG and vaccination.
- **Hepatocellular carcinoma**: number one primary tumor of liver cells which may complicate any longstanding liver disease, including HBV or cirrhosis. Screen for hepatocellular carcinoma with serum alpha fetoprotein every six months in addition to ultrasonography.
- Hepatitis B oncogenesis: because HBV is a DNA virus, it integrates randomly into the host genome and therefore can cause increased genomic instability and its X gene product acts as a transcriptional transactivator of *myc* family oncogenes.

### Hepatitis D "Delta"
- Smallest virus known to infect man
- Resembles plant viruses
- Degenerate: **needs hepatitis B surface antigen** in order to enter hepatocytes
- Very uncommon in WNY
- Acute co-infection with hepatitis B or super-infection on top of chronic hepatitis B.
- Diagnosis: HBsAg, Anti-HDV antibodies, HDV RNA PCR
- Treatment: Interferon, but doesn't work very well.
- Prognosis: grim

### Immune Pathogenesis
- Under most conditions, hepatitis viruses are non-cytopathic
- It is the **immune response** to viral antigents that kills liver cells (thus causing symptoms, signs, fibrosis, and death) or kills viruses (responsible for viral clearance)
- Weak immune response leads to few symptoms initially, but paradoxically leads to viral persistence
- Over-aggressive immune response leads to severe hepatitis and death
- Thus, it is a delicate balance: too many cells die and you have fulminant hepatic failure, not enough virus is eradicated and you'll get chronic disease.

### Hepatitis C
- Prevalence: 500 million world wide, ~1-2% of the US population, 3.8 million Americans afflicted. 15-20k in WNY. 18% of Vietnam veterans. NHANES 
- Transmission: Needle sharing, blood transfusion (pre-1990), nasal cocaine, tattoos (not any more!), health care workers. Prisons!
- Clinical course: incubation period is 60 days, acute hepatitis is very mild but chronic hepatitis C is very common. Symptoms and signs are few until advanced disease is present! Screen baby boomers due to IV drug abuse at that time.
- Diagnosis: elevated aminotransferases, antibodies to HCV proteins, molecular tests. ELISA easy, inexpensive, and the best initial screening test. PCR or bDNA is expensive, but can quantitate a current infection. Most common genotype in USA is 1; genotype 2 and 3 found moreso in Europe.
- Poor prognosticators: alcohol use or abuse, acquisition by transfusion, male gender.
- Management: reassure, educate, avoid alcohol. Consider specific treatment with <s>long-acting interferon, ribavirin, telaprevir, boceprevir,</s> **sofosbuvir**, simipravir. Cannot give interferon to patients with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or significant active mental illness. IFN and ribavirin are also very poorly tolerated. Good thing: we have entered the age of direct acting antivirals!! These drugs, like **sofosbuvir** are used in combination, have minimal side effects, and nearly 100% cure rates. Major problem: it's $1000 per pill.

### Hepatitis E
- Enteric transmitted, non-A/non-B hepatitis
- Very uncommon in the US
- Very common in the 3rd world
- Clinically similar to hepatitis A
- Excellent prognosis except in pregnant women

<span><br></span>

### Hepatitis F
- F = fulminant! Development of encephalopathy within eight weeks of the onset of symptoms in a patient with a previously healthy liver.
- Pretty uncommon
- Poor prognosis, major cause likely Tylenol
- Transplant is often needed!

### Hepatitis G
- Isolated from surgeon blood
- Common, but cause of hepatic inflammation or innocent bystander?
- Suppresses HIV replication
