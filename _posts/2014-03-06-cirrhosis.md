### Cirrhosis Overview
- Cirrhosis ("scar of the liver") represents the final common pathway of many hepatic disorders, and is characterized by chronic cellular destruction and fibrosis followed by formation of parenchymal regeneration nodules.
- Hepatic fibrosis is caused by **stellate cells** which are transformed into myofibroblasts by inflammatory cytokines released by Kupffer cells and by phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies. Stellate cells produce collagen and inhibitors of metalloproteinases.
- **Micronodular** cirrhosis is historically associated with alcohol injury, whereas **macronodular** cirrhosis is typical of viral injury.
- Cirrhosis can result from any chronic insult of the liver, be it inflammation, genetic disorder, bile flow obstruction, or vascular ischemia. Fatty liver diseases and hepatitis viruses are common causes, whereas infrequent causes include PBC, autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, or sclerosing cholangitis.
- Symptoms are few in early stages, but many in later stages. Symptoms include fatigue, malaise, weakness, pruritis, and confusion.
- Signs also correlate with liver status, include jaundice, muscle wasting, hyper-estrogenemia, spider angiomas, palmar erythema, gynecomastia, excoriations (from pruritis), and ascites.
- **Labs**: elevation of aminotransferases, if liver insult is still ongoing. True liver function tests, bilirubin, albumin, and coagulation factors will be deranged in proportion to the severity of disease. WBC decrease and thrombocytopenia also present due to splenic sequestration.
- **Metabolic derangements**: jaundice (due to poor processing of bilirubin), hyperestrogenemia (again, can't break down various estrogen species), diabetes (due to poor sugar regulation), hypo- OR hyperlipidemia, and/or hypoalbuminemia (may also be due to poor nutrition or malabsorption). Toxemia will lead to portosystemic encephalopathy, see below.

### Portal hypertension
- Increased hepatic resistance to blood flow from the portal vein and hepatic artery. 
- Portal hypertension leads to development of collateral circulation and is responsible for esophageal varices, caput medusae, hemorrhoids, ascites. 
- Portal hypertension is also responsible for systemic vasodilation, which leads to salt and water retention, which leads to ascites.

### Esophageal Varices
- Suspect in any bleeding patient with liver disease. 
- Usually massive hematemesis with or without hematochezia or melena. 
- Emergency: Start 2x large bore IVs and fluid resuscitate promptly, consider blood transfusions or clotting factors but use judiciously. 
- Treatment: Octreotide may be used to decrease blood flow into the gut and thus decrease portal pressure, but real solution is upper GI endoscopy with sclerotherapy or banding. NG balloon can tamponade temporarily but generally associated with poor outcomes.

### Ascites
- Pathological accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. "My underfilled cup overfloweth". Fluid overload status but with intravascular depletion. 
- May be due to cirrhosis, malignancy, heart failure, or pancreatitis. 
- Diagnosis: physical exam, shifting dullness to percussion, or ultrasound. 
- Problem is caused when portosystemic anastomoses leads to gut products in systemic circulation, triggering TNF-, IL-1-, and NO-mediated systemic vasodilation, which triggers the kidney to retain salt and water. Because of the cirrhosis, there is sinusoidal hypertension and impaired lymph return, so fluid literally drips off of the liver and into the abdominal cavity. 
- Diagnostic paracentesis and fluid analysis is very important! **Albumin** ratio: serum - ascites albumin gradient of > 1.1 suggests cirrhosis. Also get cytology to rule out tumors, amylase to check pancreatic damage, and cultures to look for TB or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. 
- Treatment: improve liver function, restrict salt, start diuretics, consider TIPS
- Complications: **Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis**: high mortality but subtle presentation. Need diagnostic paracentesis. Treat with IV antibiotics. **Hepatorenal syndrome**: renal failure in the setting of cirrhosis, characterized by extreme vasoconstriction in an otherwise normal kidney. Diagnosis of exclusion. Treat with systemic vasocontrictors, dialysis, transplant? **Hepatic encephalopathy**: spectrum of mental status changes seen in advanced liver disease. Graded I-IV, I: subtle cognitive deficit, II: asterixis, slow speech, lethargy, III: obtunded but arousable, IV: comatose. Presumably mediated by gut toxin that escapes liver metabolism, may be ammonia or endogenous benzodiazepenes, false neurotransmitters, or even short chain fatty acids. Gets worse by protein in the gut (due to more ammonia), renal failure, sedatives, or infection. Treat by avoiding and treating precipitants, laxatives to get rid of the gut protein, and maybe benzodiazepene antagonists.
