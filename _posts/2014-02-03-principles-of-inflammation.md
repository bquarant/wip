- Consequences of vascular events?
- Role of adhesion molecules and mediators?
- Control of inflammatory response and treatment?

### Introductory clinical case
- 30 year old male working in his garage cutting lumber sustains a 5cm laceration on his right upper extremity.
- The wound bled for a few minutes, then the surrounding skin became red at 10 minutes post-injury. Skin was red, puffy, warm, and painful at 30 minutes. Pain, swelling, and erythema improved by 48 hours. 
- **Questions to be asked**: Why is the wound red, warm, and swollen? What is the cause of the pain? What is the pathologic process? What will happen to such an injury, and what are the consequences of untreated wounds?

### Inflammation - a definition
- Means: "to set aflame or on fire"
- Universal response in vascular tissue; many causes produce the same response.
- Ranges from minor to complicated (e.g., handling an infection)
- Double-edged sword: is protective but causes destructive collateral damage.

<span><br></span>

### Triggers and types of inflammation
- Physical trigger: trauma, surgery
- Chemical trigger: medicine, drugs, poisons
- Infection trigger: bacteria, fungi, viruses
- Immune reaction trigger: allergy, auto-immune
- Physiologic trigger: necrosis, ischemia.
- Note that not all injuries cause inflammation, for example, metabolic diseases.
- Types of inflammation: Acute, subacute, chronic. May transition from acute to chronic.

### Signs of inflammation
- Rubor (erythema, redness, hyperemia). Host advantage: 
- Calor (warmth). 
- Tumor (swelling, edema, wheal if localized)
- Dolor (pain)
- Loss of function (fifth sign, added by Virchow)

<span><br></span>

### A cast of characters, briefly
- Polymorphonuclear neutrophils, colorful but messy
- Monocytes: aggressive, "ready for the fight". 
- Macrophages: more delicate eaters. 
- Lymphocyte: "cranky, opinionated," play important role in chronic inflammation

<span><br></span>

### Vascular events in inflammation, roughly chronologically
- Step one - **Vasoconstriction**: very brief period
- Step two - **Vasodilation**: arterioles at first, leading to increased blood flow, leading to erythema (rubor) and heat (calor)
- Step three - **Stasis**: capillaries and venules. Flow slows down due to vasodilation, hemoconcentration causes increased viscosity, which promotes margination of the leukocytes
- Of note: **Venturi effect**: "velocity in a larger caliber vessel (i.e. a vasodilated capillary bed) is slower, but total flow in the system increases"

<span><br></span>

### Vascular permeability mechanisms
- Often a combination of the following mechanisms. Mediator dependent. Depending how "leaky" the vessels, you'll get fluid, then protein, then cells.
- **Transudate** - specific gravity less than 1.012, mostly water, clearish
- **Exudate** - specific gravity greater than 1.020, contains cells, proteins.
- **Endothelial gap formation**: endothelial cells contract, leaving space between. Mediated by phosphorylation of contractile proteins. Mediated early by vasoactive amines, i.e. histaminee
- **Direct vessel injury**: necrosis vs. apoptosis, sustained (days in length due to )
- **Neutrophil adhesion**: "leukocyte dependent injury," PMNs degranulate lysosomal enzymes and free radicals when they adhere to the endothelium, leading to endothelial damage and increased leakiness.  Mostly venules and pulmonary capillaries. Late response, long-lived (hours-days)
- **Transcytosis**: transport of vesicles of fluid (of vascular origin) through the endothelial cell, liberating interstitial fluid. Mediated by **VEGF** which increases the number of vesicles.
- **Starling forces in an intact vessel**: If vascular pressure is high, fluid will leave the vessel (this isn't a major factor in inflammation though.) If **interstitial colloidal pressure** is high, this too will promote fluid to leave the vessel. This is a factor late in inflammation as cells break down and effectively "pull" fluid out of the vessel.

### Inflammation - Cellular Events
- **Margination** - not receptor-mediated! Due to Venturi effect.
- **Tethering** (very loose adhesion) 
- **Rolling** (intermittent adhesion): mediated by Sialyl-Lewis antigen on leukocyte and E- and P-selectin on the endothelial cells.
- **Firm adhesion and pavementation**: mediated by LFA-1 integrin on leukocyte, and ICAM-1 immunoglobulin on endothelial cells.
- **Transmigration or diapedesis**: mediated by PECAM-1 auto-interaction on leukocytes and endothelial cells.
- **Chemotaxis and aggregation**: Various receptors on the leukocytes cause cell architectural change to pull towards concentration gradient. Typical chemotactic agents include **C5a, IL-8, LTB<sub>4</sub>, kallikrein**
- **Phagocytosis**: PMNs are sloppy eaters, macrophages are more polite eaters.
- "Normally, cells flow towards the center of the vessel lumen, when there is stasis and hemoconcentration, the cells marginate and move towards the endothelial wall"

<span><br></span>

### Adhesion Molecules
- **Selectins**: lectin-like, transmembrane glycoproteins, selectins bind to addressins with Lewis X and allow weak binding for tethering and rolling. Examples: E- (ELAM-1), and P- selectin on endothelial cells. 
- **Addressin**: bind to a lectin domain, all have a *sialyl-Lewis X* carbohydrate group.
- **Integrins** bind to matrix or endothelium, dimeric with alpha and beta chain, example: ICAM. Defect: LAD-1 (See: immunology PIDD lecture). 
- **Immunoglobulin superfamily**: bind to integrins of WBCs. Example: ICAM/CD18, VCAM.
- *Q: Why don't the endothelial cells and WBCs stick together all the time?* **Weibel-Palade bodies** ("signature organelle of the endothelial cell") inside the endothelial cells are activated by histamine or thrombin, leading to increased surface expression of P-selectin. Another example: ICAM and VCAM when exposed to TNF or IL-1 move into a reversible higher affinity state and then allow adhesion.
- *Q: What is a patient lacks adhesion molecules?* Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1: LAD-1. Patients are deficient in integrin **beta chain** synthesis, leading to impaired adhesion and deficient phagocytosis. Patients with LAD1 have recurrent bacterial infections. (More in this covered earlier in immunology lecture: see LAD-1 presenting as apurulent omphalitis).
- *Chronic inflammation and adhesion molecules*: Chronic inflammation is mediated by a continual interaction between the endothelium and WBCs, both selectins and integrin systems have been implicated.

### Transmigration or diapedesis
- **PECAM-1** is autophilic, binds to itself, and is used by all WBCs for transmigration.
- Cells are able to pierce the basement membrane using **collagenases**
- WBCs move through the vessel wall, largely interendothelial movement. PMNs in first 24 hours, monocytes and macrophages after 48 hours.

<span><br></span>

### Chemotaxis
- WBCs attracted to focus of injury (necrosis, bacterial products) or to chemokines bound to ECM.
- Mediators like C5a, LTB<sub>4</sub>, bind to WBC receptors to start the process.
- *How it works*: Neutrophil has chemotactic factor receptors on its surface. Say C5a binds to this receptor, activates **phospholipase C**, leading to PIP2 and **IP3** activation which triggers increased cellular **Ca2+** leading to assembly of contractile proteins. These proteins create pseudopod formation, which pulls the cell in the direction of the concentration gradient.
- "Chemotactic factors" and "homing chemokine" gradient influence the direction of movement

<span><br></span>

### Leukocyte activation
- Three key events:
- Expression of adhesion molecules
- Production of cytokines, mediators
- Degranulation
- *How it works*: Activating factor binds to receptor, works on phospholipase C-IP3 axis to increase intracellular calcium, increases adhesion molecule expression, which activates **PG production**  which then activates protein kinase C and then degranulation

<span><br></span>

### Phagocytosis
- PMNs and Macrophages:
- *Recognition and attachment*: **opsonins (Fc of IgG and C3b)** coat bacterial surface. Phosphatidylserine (normally found in higher concentration on cytoplasmic bilayer) rotates to cell surface. Thrombospondin also expressed on cell surface. 
- *Engulfment* leads to phagosome internalization
- *Degradation* after phagolyososome formation
