### Learning Objectives
- Signs of acute inflammation and host advantages of these reactions?

- Sequential events in acute inflammation?
- Mechanisms of events in inflammation?
- Consequences of vascular events?
- Role of adhesion molecules and mediators?
- Control of inflammatory response and treatment?

### Introductory Clinical Case
- 30 year old male working in his garage cutting lumber sustains a 5cm laceration on his right upper extremity.
- The wound bled for a few minutes, then the surrounding skin became red at 10 minutes post-injury. Skin was red, puffy, warm, and painful at 30 minutes. Pain, swelling, and erythema improved by 48 hours. 
- **Questions to be asked**: Why is the wound red, warm, and swollen? What is the cause of the pain? What is the pathologic process? What will happen to such an injury, and what are the consequences of untreated wounds?

### Inflammation - A Definition
- Means: "to set aflame or on fire"
- Universal response in vascular tissue; many causes produce the same response.
- Ranges from minor to complicated (e.g., handling an infection)
- Double-edged sword: is protective but causes destructive collateral damage.

<span><br></span>

### Triggers and Types of Inflammation
- Physical trigger: trauma, surgery
- Chemical trigger: medicine, drugs, poisons
- Infection trigger: bacteria, fungi, viruses
- Immune reaction trigger: allergy, auto-immune
- Physiologic trigger: necrosis, ischemia.
- Note that not all injuries cause inflammation, for example, metabolic diseases.
- Types of inflammation: Acute, subacute, chronic. May transition from acute to chronic.

### Signs of Inflammation
- Rubor (erythema, redness, hyperemia). Host advantage: 
- Calor (warmth). 
- Tumor (swelling, edema, wheal if localized)
- Dolor (pain)
- Loss of function (fifth sign, added by Virchow)

<span><br></span>

### Cast of Characters
- Polymorphonuclear neutrophils, colorful but messy
- Monocytes: aggressive, ready for 
- Lymphocyte: "cranky, opinionated" important in chronic inflammation

<span><br></span>

### Sequential Vascular Events
1. Vasoconstriction: very brief
2. Vasodilation: arterioles at first, increased blood flow, leads to erythema and heat
3. Stasis: capillaries and venules. Flow slows down due to vasodilation, hemoconcentration causes increased viscosity, which promotes margination of the leukocytes
-Venturi effect: although the total flow increases, the velocity is slower

<span><br></span>

### Permeability Mechanisms
- **Endothelial gap formation**: endothelial cells contract, leaving space between. Mediated by phosphorylation of contractile proteins. Mediated early by vasoactive amines, i.e. histaminee
- **Direct vessel injury**: necrosis vs. apoptosis, sustained (days in length due to )
- **Neutrophil adhesion**: "leukocyte dependent injury," PMNs degranulate lysosomal enzymes and free radicals when they adhere to the endothelium, leading to endothelial damage and increased leakiness.  Mostly venules and pulmonary capillaries. Late response, long-lived (hours-days)
- **Transcytosis**: transport of vesicles of fluid (of vascular origin) through the endothelial cell, liberating interstitial fluid. Mediated by **VEGF** which increases the number of vesicles.
- Depending how "leaky" the vessels, you'll get fluid, then protein, then cells.

<span><br></span>

### Catch up - slides 40-42
- Increased colloid pressure from cell/tissue breakdown will cause more fluid to be "pulled" from the vessel, increasing edema

<span><br></span>

### Inflammation - Cellular Events
- Margination
- Tethering (very loose adhesion)
- Rolling (intermittent adhesion)
- Firm adhesion and pavementation: integrins, immunoglobulins
- Transmigration or diapedesis
- Chemotaxis and aggregation
- Phagocytosis: PMNs are sloppy eaters, macrophages are more polite eaters.
- "Normally, cells flow towards the center of the vessel lumen, when there is stasis and hemoconcentration, the cells marginate and move towards the endothelial wall"

<span><br></span>

### Adhesion Molecules
- **selectins**: lectin-like, transmembrane glycoproteins, selectins bind to addressins with Lewis X and allow weak binding for tethering and rolling. 
- **Addressin**: bind to a lectin domain, all have a *sialyl-Lewis X* carbohydrate group. 
- **Integrins** bind to matrix or endothelium, dimeric with alpha and beta chain, example: ICAM. Defect: LAD-1 (See: immunology PIDD lecture). 
- **Immunoglobulin superfamily**: bind to integrins of WBCs. Example: ICAM, VCAM.
- **P-selectin** binds to sialyl-Lewis X (all WBCs!), involved in tethering
- **ELAM-1 E-selecting** binds to sialyl-Lewis X on PMNs and monocytes (thus more specific), involved in rolling
- **ICAM-1** binds to CD18, allows for adhesion
- *Why don't the endothelial cells and WBCs stick together all the time?* Weibel-Palade bodies ("signature organelle of the endothelial cell") inside the endothelial cells are activated by histamine or thrombin, leading to increased surface expression of P-selectin. Another example: ICAM and VCAM when exposed to TNF or IL-1 move into a reversible higher affinity state and then allow adhesion.
- *Chronic inflammation and adhesion molecules*: CD34:L-selectin (lymphocytes). **FOLLOW UP: SLIDE 56**
- *What is a patient lacks adhesion molecules?* Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1: LAD-1. Patients are deficient in integrin beta chain syntehsis, leading to impaired adhesion and deficient phagocytosis. Patients with LAD1 have recurrent bacterial infections. (See immmunology: LAD-1/LFA-/- presenting as apurulent omphalitis).

### Transmigration
- PECAM is autophilic, binds to itself, and is used by all WBCs. 
- Allows for transmigration.
- Pierces basement membrane using collagenases
- WBCs move through the vessel wall, largely interendothelial movement. PMNs in first 24 hours, monocytes and macrophages after 48 hours.

<span><br></span>

### Chemotaxis
- WBCs attracted to focus of injury (necrosis, bacterial products) or to chemokines bound to ECM.
- Mediators like C5a, LTB4, bind to WBC receptors to start the process.
- *How it works*: Neutrophil has chemotactic factor receptors on its surface. Say C5a binds to this receptor, activates **phospholipase C**, leading to PIP2 and **IP3** activation which triggers increased cellular **Ca2+** leading to assembly of contractile proteins. These proteins create pseudopod formation, which pulls the cell in the direction.
- "Chemotactic factors" and "Homing chemokine" gradient influence the direction of movement

<span><br></span>

### Leukocyte activation
- Three key events:
- Expression of adhesion molecules
- Production of cytokines, mediators
- Degranulation
- *How it works*: Activating factor binds to receptor, works on phospholipase C-IP3 axis to increase intracellular calcium, increases adhesion molecule expression, which activates **PG production**  which then activates protein kinase C and then degranulation

<span><br></span>

### Phagocytosis
- PMNs and Macrophages:
- *Recognition and attachment*: **opsonins (Fc of IgG and C3b)** coat bacterial surface. Phosphatidylserine rotates to cell surface. Thrombospondin also expressed on cell surface. 
- *Engulfment* leads to phagosome internalizastion
- *Degradation* after phagolyososome formation
