### Drug Receptor Interactions and the Law of Mass Action
- \[R\] + \[X\] = \[RX\]
- \[R\] = \[R<sub>T</sub>\] - \[RX\]
- K<sub>D</sub> = dissociation constant, by Law of Mass Action
- __EQ1: K<sub>D</sub> = \(\[R\]\*\[X\]\) / \[RX\]__
- __EQ2: \[RX\]/ \[R<sub>T</sub>\] = \(\[X\] / K<sub>D</sub> \+ \[X\]\)__

<span><br></span> 
### The Occupancy Assumption
- The magnitude of the pharmacological effect, __E__ is proportional to __\[RX\]__
- Applying the occupancy assumption to __EQ2__ you get:
- __EQ3: E/E<sub>max</sub> = \(\[X\] / K<sub>D</sub> \+ \[X\]\)__

<span><br></span> 
### Graphical Representation of the Drug-Receptor Interaction
- Plot __E__ or __E/E<sub>max</sub>__
-  When __E/E<sub>max</sub>__ = 50%, K<sub>D</sub> = \[X\]

### A Note on Spare Receptors
- When a maximum response __E<sub>max</sub>__ is observed when not all receptors are occupied, the system is said to have spare receptors.
- Example: maximum inotropic response from cardiac muscle by a beta-adrenoceptor agonist when 90% of the receptors are blocked.

### Dose-Effect Relationship and the Assumption of the Isolated System
- "isolated system" - assumption that there is a direct relationship between the calculated drug concentrations in the experiment and the concentration of drug that the receptor is exposed to.
- Patients are not isolated systems, in any sense!

<span><br></span> 
### Affinity
- __Affinity__ is a measure of the probability that a drug molecule will interact with its receptor form the drug-receptor complex
- Affinity is inversely proportional to K<sub>D</sub>

<span><br></span> 
### Intrinsic Activity
- __Intrinsic activity__ is a measure of the biological effectiveness of \[RX\]
- A proportionality constant, named k<sub>ia</sub>, relates the quantity of receptor-drug complex to the magnitude of the pharmacological effect produced.
- __E = k<sub>ia</sub>\[RX\]__

<span><br></span> 
### The Dose-Effect Relationship in Intact Organisms: Potency and Efficacy
- In contrast with isolated systems, you can't assume a direct relationship between dose to the patient and concentration at the receptors.
- __Potency__ refers to the quantity of the drug required to produce a specific effect.
- Lower \[X\] for a same level of effect? Higher potency.
- Don't expect a constant relationship between __affinity__ and __potency__

- __Efficacy__ refers to a drug's ability to produce a maximum therapeutic effect.

### Potency vs. Efficacy
- Confusion may arise when potency is defined by lay dictionaries as "the capability of causing strong physiological or chemical effects as medicines or alcoholic beverages"
- Comparative efficacies and potencies: heroin vs. morphine
