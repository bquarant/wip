### Objectives
- **follow up!**

### The Complete Blood Count
- Automated cell counter that measures the following parameters: White blood cell count (WBC), Red blood cell count (RBC), platelet count (PLT), hemaglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), and RBC indices (MCV, MCHC, MCH, RDW).

<span><br></span>

### WBC Differential
- What types of white blood cells are present in the peripheral smear?
- Results may be reported in percents and/or **absolute cell counts**. Why? You can have 80% lymphocytes, 15% neutrophils, but if your WBC is too low or too high, you could be either neutropenic or in lymphocytosis.
- Automated methods have been developed, combines blood smear preparation and staining. Advantages include minimal exposure to biohazardous material, increased consistency, increased optimal counting area.
- Manual method uses a "wedge" approach. Why review a peripheral smear? Primarily to review abnormalities identified by the CBC analyzer (e.g. confirm numerical numerical findings, schistocytes)
- CBC analyzers cannot pick up RBC shape changes, but often the indices point to an abnormality.
- Peripheral smears will be reviewed if: **follow up slide 19**

### Red Blood Cells
- RBCs: size (microcytic, macrocytic, anisocytosis), color (hypochromic, normochromic), variation of shape (poikilocytosis, e.g. sickle cell anemia, hemoglobin C crystals). Nucleated RBCs, Howell-Jolly Bodies, intracellular pathogens (e.g. malaria)
- How to judge RBC size: make sure you're in the right area of the peripheral smear, then use the nucleus of a normal, small lymphocyte for a guiding reference.  The variation in cell size is measured by the RDW: small RDW, little variation; large RDW, large variation.
- **Reticulocytes**: RBC newly released from the bone marrow has cytoplasm with a bluish-tinged cytoplasm due to residual RNA. Called a polychromatic RBC on Wright's stain, to confirm they are reticulocytes use supravital staining. For anemic patients, a low number of reticulocytes implies that there is inadequate production (this is a bad sign!).

### Neutrophilic Findings of Notes
- **Follow up: slide 41**

<span><br></span>
### Leukemoid Reaction
- Persistent moderate to extreme reactive lymphocytosis, usually due to neutrophils. Usually seen in sepsis or other critical illness.

<span><br></span>
### Leukoerythroblastic reaction
- Bone marrow response where nucleated red blood cells and immature leukocytes are released in the peripheral blood
- Usually due to a space-occupying lesion in the bone marrow, such as bone marrow fibrosis, marrow involvement of metastatic tumor.

### Myelophthisis,
- **Follow up slide 48**

<span><br></span>
### Eosinophilic Disorder

<span><br></span>
### Basophilic Disorder
- Consider myeloproliferative neoplasm!

<span><br></span>
### Monocytes
- Monocytosis: an absolute increase in monocytes. Consider infections, reactive processes, myeloid neoplasms

<span><br></span>
### Lymphocytosis
- Reactive lymphocytosis and atypical lymphocytosis
- Consider: unknown viral infection, infectious mononucleosis, *B. pertussis*. Atypical lymphocytes in hematology means benign, reactive lymphocytes!
- **Blasts** - primitive cells. May be of lymphoid, myeloid, or unclassified origin. May be acute leukemia... **follow up slide 59**

### Platelet Reasons to Review a Peripheral Smear
- Spurious thrombocytopenia can occur due to EDTA-induced platelet clumping.
- Platelets can be small, normal, large, or giant.
- Platelet satellitism and clumping - affects the platelet count!
