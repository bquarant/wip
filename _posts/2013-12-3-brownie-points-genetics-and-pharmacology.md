## Genetics
<br>
 
### Risk assessment using family history
- **Autosomal Dominant \(Ad\)**: 50% recurrence risk to offspring, males and females equally affected.
- **Autosomal Recessive \(ar\)**: Parent of affected individual obligate carrier; 50% carrier risk to grandparents, aunts, and uncles of affected individual; transmission risk is 50%
- **Autosomal Recessive Calculation**: \(Mom's risk\) \*  \(Dad's risk\) \* \(Transmission risk\) 
- **X-Linked Calculation**: \(Mom's risk\) \*  \(Dad's risk\) \* \(Transmission risk\) \* \(Gender risk\)

### Risk assessment using Hardy-Weinberg
- Calculating the risk of carrier or affected status of a autosomal recessive or X-linked disease requires knowledge about both parents.
- If the carrier status of one of the parents cannot be determined by family history, you need to assume a frequency from population genetics
- Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium: p + q = 1; (p+q)<sup>2</sup> = 1; p<sup>2</sup> + 2pq + q<sup>2</sup> = 1
- **Incidence rate == q<sup>2</sup>**
- Take square root of incidence rate to get q
- Assume p is close enough to 1 that the difference is negligible
- **Carrier probability == 2q**

### Mechanisms of Prader-Willi Syndrome and Angelman Syndrome
**Prader-Willi Syndrome \(PWS\)**: caused by absence of paternal 15q11-13
- PWS presents with short stature, cognitive and language deficits, hyperphagia, hypogonadicism
- PWS caused by paternal 15q11-13 deletion \(70%\), maternal uniparental disomy \(30%\), or imprinting center mutation \(1%\)
- Diagnosis: FISH, DNA methylation study

<br>


**Angelman Syndrome \(AS\)**: caused by an absence of maternal 15q11-13
- AS presents with severe developmental delay, wide-based gait, neurogenic laughter
- AS caused by maternal 15q11-13 deletion \(68%\), paternal uniparental disomy \(7%\), imprinting center mutation, *UBE3A* mutation, idiopathic
- Diagnosis: FISH, DNA methylation study, chromosome microarray
- Negative methylation study does not rule out AS due to other genetic etiologies

### Uses of MSAFP
- AFP is to the fetus what serum albumin is to the child postnatally.  
- Its concentration his highest in fetal blood, so bleeding elevates AFP concentration in amniotic fluid, as does the leakage of cerebrospinal fluid in amniotic fluid (hence the effects of open neural tube defects).  
- Abnormalities involving leakage of fetal CSF or blood will increase the AFP concentration in amniotic fluid as well as in the mother's blood.  
- Normal newborns have very high concentrations of AFP in serum, but this rapidly decreases and is replaced by serum albumin produced in the newbornâ€™s liver.

### Linkage analysis
- DNA linkage analysis uses polymorphic inherited sequences to track nearby sequences of interest from one person to another within the pedigree.  
- This technique could be used to confirm transmission of a disease-related gene from a parent to, for example, a fetus if the purpose is for prenatal diagnosis.  
- Testing for rare, disease-related alleles or mutations is better done by direct analysis using oligonucleotides or sequencing methods.

### Nomenclature of mutations

### Recognition of sex chromosome abnormalities in the newborn

### Clinical indications for chromosome microarray analysis
- Microarray analysis is very effective in looking for deletions and duplications large regions such as chromosomes or even the entire genome.

## Pharmacology
<br>

### Drug receptor definition

### Representative types of receptors
	- Ligand-gated ion channel
	- Membrane-embedded enzyme
	- G protein-coupled receptor
	- Transcription factor

### Drug names:  chemical, generic, proprietary [trade]


### Multiple receptors for drugs, e.g., lidocaine, tamoxifen/selective toxicity


### Binding forces in the drug-receptor complex
	- Irreversible:  covalent
	- Reversible:  ionic, hydrogen, dipole-dipole, van der Waals, hydrophobic
	
	
### SP3 hybridization, centers of chirality, stereoselectivity of receptors, racemic mixtures


### Drug-receptor interactions, the law of mass action, the occupancy assumption:  E/Emax = [X]/[Kd + X] 


### Semi-log plots:  E/Emax vs log of concentration or dose


### Spare receptors


### Concentration-effect relationship in isolated systems:  affinity and intrinsic activity


### Dose-effect relationship in intact systems:  potency and efficacy


### Drug interactions:  summation and potentiation


### Drug interactions:  antagonism
	Definition of an agonist 
	Definition of an antagonist
	
	
### Types of antagonism
	Physiological
	Pharmacological
		Surmountable
		Insurmountable
		
		
### Partial agonists [agonist/antagonists]


### Constitutively active systems:  inverse agonism


### Therapeutic index, multiple indices


### Dose-response relationships:  graded vs quantal


### Weak acids and bases:  role of ionization in lipid solubility/renal excretion 


### Binding of drugs to plasma proteins


### Blood-brain barrier/placental barrier 


### Routes of administration
	Enteral:  	by mouth [per os, PO] and the first pass effect
			Mucous membranes 
	Parenteral:	intra-arterial
			Intra-venous
			Sub-cutaneous
			Intramuscular
			Epidural
			Intrathecal
			Intra-osseus
	Other routes:  transdermal
			   Respiratory tract
