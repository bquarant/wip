### Objectives
- Recognize the typical clinical presentation of SCID
- Understand the different categories and genetic causes of SCID
- Understand pathogenesis and adenosine deaminase deficient SCID
- Develop basic understanding of laboratory evaluation and treatment options for SCID.

### SCID Case presentation
- HPI: 15 m/o F presenting w/ 4th episode of PNA.
- Physical: FTT, afebrile, multiple findings.
- CBC at admission: WBC 3.4, 3% lymphs  (ALC 72)
- CXR: normal at 6 months, now with bilateral lower lobe infiltrates. Absent thymic shadow.
- Chest CT: brochiectasis and bilateral patchy infiltrates.
- Blood: Low IgG, very low CD3+, CD4+, CD8+. Plasma ADA level = 0, dAXP = 0.347.
- Assessment: Consistent with ADA deficient SCID.
- Treatment: IVIG infusions and ADA enzyme replacement therapy (Adagen). Patient did develop cellulitis, sepsis, and EBV infection before immune modulation. 3 months after Adagen, dAXP was undetectable and normal lymphocyte count had returned. 12 months of adagen, IVIG was able to be discontinued.

### SCID Overview
- Disorder of T cell number and function with variable B cell and NK cell defects.
- Present within first several months of life with chronic diarrhea, FTT, and emaciation.
- Recurrent infections typically involve fungi, viruses, and opportunistic infections. 
- Fatal within 2 years without immune reconstitution.

### SCID Classification
- T lymphocytopenia is consistent in all classical SCID
- Impact on B cells and NK cells is variable, depending on the genetic defect.
- "Leaky" SCID might have some abnormal circulating T cells.
- Remember to compare cell levels with age-specific groups! Lymphopenia in infancy is 3000 cells/ml, T-cell lymphopenia is 1800 cells/ml
- **T-B-NK- SCID**: pan-lymphocyte development defect, very early defect. Cell-toxicity metabolic defect could also do this. Reticular dysgenesis, ADA deficiency.
- **T-B-NK+ SCID**: failure of T-cell and B-cell antigen receptor development. Protein deficiencies "stop the rearrangements from happening." Recombinant genes are the cause here. (RAG, Artemis, Ligase IV, PNP).
- **T-B+NK- SCID**: IL-2 gamma chain deficiency, Jak3 deficiency.
- **T-B+NK+ SCID**: Defect in the CD3 receptor. IL-7R(alpha), CD3(gamma, epsilon, delta) deficiencies
- Mutations in only 10 genes account for more than 95% of SCID

### Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency
- Normal lymphocytes: dATP breaks down to deoxyadenosine. ADA breaks deoxyadenosine to deoxyinosine, which then gets broken down to uric acid and excreted. 
- ADA deficiency leads to build up of dATP, causing cell death.
- 15% of SCID have ADA, 85% of those are lymphopenic at birth.
- Highest ADA activity is in lymphoid cells, especially immature thymocytes, thus most significantly affected by toxicity when deficient.
- Other organ systems are involved: skeletal dysplasia, liver dysfunction, neurologicla symptoms
- SCID is an immunological emergency: infants are healthy are birth but die due to severe infections in infancy and is uniformly fatal if immune reconstitution is not performed.
- Survival for 3.5 years after bone marrow transplant is 95%.
- Early identification is essential because rotavirus vaccine is a live-attenuated vaccine and will cause pathology in SCID.
- Lab evaluation: get an absolute lymphocyte count, quantify T cells and susets, evaluate for naive T cells, genetic testing for specific mutations. Of note, newborn screening for T-cell defects is now being performed in 26 states.
- TREC positive: indicates that T cells have undergone V-(D)-J rearrangement. Sign of a healthy T-cell in the peripheral blood.

### Treatment Options in SCID
- *Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation*: from a matched related family donor, or a haplo-indentical family donor, matched unrelated donor. 
- *Gene therapy*: delayed due to clonal expansion and malignancy in X-SCID and CGD.
- *Enzyme replacement*: Adagen can replace adenosine deaminase in ADA-SCID, but 20% don't respond and 40% still need IVIG.
