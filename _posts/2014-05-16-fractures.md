### Introduction
- The hand defines most of our tactile interaction with the outside world
- It is unique, and highly specialized compared with the rest of the animal kingdom
- The hand has receptors for position sense, vibration, temperature, and fine tactile distinction
- 2 point discrimination maximum resolution is as fine as 2mm.
- Opposable thumbs allow us to develop and refine advanced motor skills!
- Overall thought: fractures need good stability and blood supply in order to heal appropriately!

### The Elbow, Forearm, and Wrist
- The elbow is a trocho-gynglymoid (pivot and hinge) joint that allows for both bending (flexion and extension of the forearm) as well as rotation (pronation vs. supination)
- Forearm consists of the radius, ulna, interosseous membrane, and associate ligaments.
- Wrist is composed of two rows of carpal bones. Proximal row: scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, pisiform. Distal row: trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, hamate.
- Most wrist motion is "mid-carpal"...
- **Scaphoid fractures**: most commonly fractured carpal bone (typically after FOOSH). 90-95% heal if minimally displaced, but that's not good! Problems: the scaphoid has poor blood supply, is is largely intra-articular, is covered in cartilage, has poor callus formation, has no periosteum, and so and imaging might not initially be conclusive, leading to a delay in diagnosis. Majority of blood supply is distal to proximal! Conclusion: Mmust immobilize wrist in patients with anatomic snuffbox tenderness to palpation after trauma. 
- **Distal radius** fracture: Common after FOSH. Ulnar styloid fracture also common. Apex volar angulation leads to characteristic "dinner fork" deformity.
- **Carpal** fracture
- **Metacarpal** fracture: Boxer's fracture (5th metacarpal), Bennett's fracture (intra-articular fracture of the *first* metacarpal, usually unstable)
- **Phalangeal** fracture: common, avulsion fractures typical. Mallet fracture involves the insertion of the terminal extensor ligament, thus clinically appear to be held in flexion.

### Fracture healing
- **Direct Bone Healing**: direct or endosteal healing occurs in bones that are rigidly fixed, no callus visible radiographically
- **Indirect Bone Healing**: Indirect or periosteal
