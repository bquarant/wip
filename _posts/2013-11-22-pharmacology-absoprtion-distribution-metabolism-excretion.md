### Physiological Factors in Drug Absorption
- These are problems faced when considering movement of a drug from the site of application to the blood:
- Aqueous media separated by lipid barriers
- Epithelial lining of the GI tract (aquaporins, passive diffusion, active transport)
- Endothelial barrier of the capillary wall

### Physicochemical Factors in Drug Absorption
- Lipid-water partition coefficient should be an optimal value for absorption (e.g., thiopental vs. barium sulfate vs. barium chloride)
- Ionization of drugs and lipid solubility
- Acid-base equilibrium
- *Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation* = pH - pK<sub>a</sub> = log\[base\]/\[acid\]
- Thus, when pH = pK<sub>a</sub>, log\[base\]/\[acid\] = 0
- When pH < pK<sub>a</sub>, reaction shifts to the left; \[AH\] > A<sup>-</sup> by a ratio **AH/A<sup>-</sup> = antilog|pH - pK<sub>a</sub>|**
- Conversely, when pH > pK<sub>a</sub>, reaction shifts to the right; \[AH\] < A<sup>-</sup> by a ratio **A<sup>-</sup>/AH = antilog|pH - pK<sub>a</sub>|**

## Absorption Physical Chemistry Questions
1. A healthy stomach is usually an acidic environment. Would you expect a weak acid or weak base to be better absorbed in the stomach?
2. Imagine a weak acid \(pK<sub>a</sub> = 4.4 \) is placed in the stomach \(pH = 1.4\). At equilibrium, what would be the ratio of the charged form of the weak acid in the stomach to the uncharged form in the plasma \(pH = 7.4\)? Assume that the uncharged form of the weak acid freely equilibrates across lipid barriers?
3. What if you changed #2 to a weak basee with a pK<sub>a</sub> = 4.4?
4. Naltrexone / methylnaltrexone: how do you gain advantage by changing the ionization state of a drug?

### Control of the Rate of Absorption in Therapeutics and Poisoning
- Rate of perfusion \(natural differences, snake bites, local anesthetics\)
- Drug formulation \(chemical alteration, e.g. haloperidol decanoate ester; supporting media, e.g. patches \)

### Drug Distribution
- Consideration of the movement of a drug from the blood to its site of action
- **General Factors**: concentration gradient, rate of perfusion, physicochemical factors
- **Plasma Protein Binding**: X + P == XP capillary wall, renal filtration, pharmacological activity (?), displacement of other drugs
- **Relative Permeability**: liver > kidney > muscle = fetus = placenta >> brain
- **Blood-Brain Barrier**:
