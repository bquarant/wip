### Clinical case
-  64 year old male with a history of long term tobacco and alcohol abuse who presents to his internist complaining of a non-healing sore on the left side of his tongue for the past 3 months. Physical examination reveals an ulcerating lesion that measures 2.5cm as well as a firm nodule in the upper neck measuring 1.0cm and is lateral to the midline.
- Questions to ask: What is the differential diagnosis? How are the tongue and neck lesions related? Are smoking and alcohol consumption important facts in the history? What should be done next? What will happen to this patient?

### Differential diagnosis of a tongue lesion
- **Aphthous Ulcer (Canker sore)** - This is a common, recurrent painful lesion of the oral cavity. The cause is unknown, onset between 1-25 years, and typically resolve in 7 to 10 days.
- **Leukoplakia**: nonspecific term to mean white patch on the tongue. This may be premalignant and give rise to carcioma.
- **Remainder**: trauma, infection, amyloidosis, neoplasia
- Causes of mass lesions: hyperplasia, hypertrophy, edema, hemorrhage, inflammation, infection, repair (keloid vs. pyogenic granuloma), tumor (benign vs. malignant)

### Lab diagnosis of malignancy
- **Histology**: Purposes: tumor typing, tumor grading, sometimes for staging. Frozen sections used for intra-operative surgical pathology supported treatment decision making (Questions: sufficient tissue for diagnosis? Is lesion benign or malignant? Are the margins free of tumor?). Permanent sections take longer than frozen, but are better for interpretation, allow for more extensive sampling, and longer storage.
- **Cytology**: obtained by fine needle aspiration (FNA); you get good cellular data but lacks ascertainable information about the architecture, margins, or invasion. Provisional diagnosis, may need to progress to biopsy.
- **Immunohistochemistry**: "most important technique for looking at tumors". Technique uses lab-made antibodies against a variety of proteins (microbial vs. normal vs. altered cellular vs. upregulated gene products) in order to label cells that bind the antibody. This can allow for phenotypic identification of an *undifferentiated* tumor, or show increased expression of *proliferation antigens*, helping you to distinguish benign from malignant tumor types.
