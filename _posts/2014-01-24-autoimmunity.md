### Objectives
- Understand the difference between normal autoreactivity and autoimmune disease
- Appreciate the clinical and immunological aspects of an organ specific autoimmune disease - type 1 diabetes
- Appreciate the clinical and immunological aspects of a systemic autoimmune disease - systemic lupus erythematosus

### What is Autoimmune Disease?
- Autoimmune diseases are disorders in which the immune system attacks self, leading to self injury. May be organ specific or systemic.
- Autoimmune disease must be distinguished from autoreactivity, where the immune system recognizes the self but does not cause injury. The immune system is constantly surveying self. Abnormal self may be due to infections, cancer, or exposure to environmental components.
- The role of the immune system is to maintain homeostasis, balancing positive and negative influences in dynamic inequilibrium. 
- Innate immune system kills non-specifically using PRRs that immediately recognize self vs. non-self. Important for autoimmunity, contrary to the old literature!

### Tolerance: the immune system does not respond to a particular antigen
- **Ignorance**: the immune system has never been exposed to the antigen, and has no high-affinity receptors to recognize it.
- **Central deletion**: high affinity autoreactive cells are eliminated during development in the bone marrow and thymus
- **Peripheral deletion**: B- and T-cells that are autoreactive and have escaped central deletion, as well as B-cells that become autoreactive after somatic hypermutation in the germinal center can be killed off by NK cells using Fas:FasL
- **Anergy**: B- and T- cells recognize the antigen, but do not respond to it, often due to lack of strong co-stimulation
- **Active suppresion**: B- and T-cell activation occurs but is suppressed by cytokines such as TGF-beta and IL-10 by T and B regulatory cells

### Regulatory T-cells
- Multiple different types (natural Treg, induced Treg, induced Tr1, TH3, CD8 Treg), generally they all work through secretion of TGF-beta and/or IL-10.

### Regulatory B-cells
- B regs can suppress reactions to antigens
