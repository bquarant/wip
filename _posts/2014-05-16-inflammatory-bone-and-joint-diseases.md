### Overview
- Arthritis disrupts joint structure and function, leading to loss of stability, decreased range of motion, and pain.
- Major types of arthritis: **osteoarthritis** - "degenerative", **rheumatoid** - "immunologic", **crystal-induced** - due to urates or CPPD, **infectious** - "suppurative/TB", or spondyloarthritis (enthesitis) like ankylosing spondylitis or Reiter's syndrome
- Solid joints are non-synovial. Synarthroses are immovable solid joints, like the cranial sutures, gomphoses in the jaw, and ventral ribs. Amphiarthroses are slightly moveable joints and include the pubic symphysis and intervertebral discs.
- Cavitated or synovial joints are moveable, are also called diarthroses. Diarthrodial joints ends are covered in hyaline cartilage, and are the major site of disease in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid, gout, and infectious arthritis.
- Synovial membrane: synovial joints are surrounded by a capsule which contains vascularized connective tissue membrane, which produces an ultrafiltrate of plasma called synovial fluid. Two types of cells, one has phagocytic capabilities, second is epithelial and secretes various types of components like hyaluronic acid.

### Osteoarthritis
- Most common type of joint disease
- Pathogenesis includes: intrinsic abnormality and breakdown of articular hyaline cartilage, matrix abnormality, wear and tear, as well as genetic factors. But...hardly any inflammation seen, though there are some cytokines released!
- **Primary** osteoarthritis: 95% of patients, unknown etiology but associated with age, obesity, genetics, and wear. Gradual onset without major trauma. Affects a single large joint and distal finger joints.
- **Secondary** osteoarthritis: 5% of patients. Follows trauma, congenital defects, avascular necrosis, diabetes, etc. Can occur in younger patients!
- Microscope slides show: decreased amount of proteoglycans, increased water content. Increased apoptotic cell death of chondrocytes, remaining growth isogenously but can't compete with the losses. Makes cartilage weak, leading to micro-level horizontal breakdown of the cartilage.
- Cartilage breakdown products get into to synovial fluid, getting phagocytosed by activated macrophages, which can further activate other synovial membrane cells which further damages the synovial space, leading to larger more problematic vertical tearing of the cartilage.
- Net result is asymmetric but possibly complete loss of intra-articular cartilage, leading to "bone on bone" pain. **Eburnation** or polishing of the bony surface then possible. Osteophytes can also develop, due to activated synovial population leading to cell proliferation. Subchondral cysts are also possible, if increased intra-articular pressure leads to cracks on the exposed surface.	
- Osteoarthritis of the hands: Typically affects the DIP joints of older women, with loss of joint space and bony osteophyte development.

### Spondyloarthritis
- Diverse group of systemic, immune-mediated, inflammatory arthritides
- Genetically predisposed: **HLA B27+**
- RF, anti-CCP negative.
- Affects entheses (thus is an enthesitis) and joints with fibrocartilage (spine and sacroiliac joints), plus oligoarticular peripheral arthritis.
- Includes: ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter's syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, enteropathic arthritis
- **Ankylosing spondylitis**: prominent changes occur in SI joints, pelvis, and spine. Typically in young men, most are HLA B27+. Affects insertion of annulus fibrosis to their superior and inferior connections and deposition of fibrous repair tissue which over times becomes mineralized then ossified, fusing the intervertebral discs. Xray has "bamboo spine" appearance. Changes typically start in the lumbar spine and move upwards, with progressively deteriorating forward flexion and decreased mobility.
- **Reiter's Syndrome / Reactive Arthritis**: Triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis. Typically manifests as an immune reaction to a prior infection, either genitourinary or enteric. Commonly affects young males that are HLA-B27+. Joint redness, warmth, swelling, and Achilles tendon enthesitis common. Dactylitis or "sausage digits" also a manifestation.
- **Psoriatic Arthritis**: Affects about 10-20% of patients with psoriasis. Skin disease usually precedes joint symptoms. Etiology thought to be cross-reactivity between streptococcal antigens and skin keratin; suggesting a post-infectious mechanism. Oligoarticular, commonly affected are DIP joints, toes, ankles, knees, hips, wrist.
- **Crystal-induced arthritis**: Urate / Uric Acid = Gout, crystals are long and thin and negatively birefrigent; Calcium Pyrophosphate Dihydrate = Pseudo-gout, crystals are short and stubby, rhomboid, positive birefrigence (blue parallel, yellow perpendicular). Can be seen microscopically on arthrocentesis aspirate smear with polarizer. Gout: common endpoint for conditions with hyperuricemia, usually idiopathic and due to increased production with decreased excretion. Tophi = end stage.
- **Pyogenic Arthritis**: Typically hematogenous spread. Common bugs are S. aureus and H. influenzae.

### Osteomyelitis
- Inflammation, usually due to infection of bone and bone marrow.
- Organisms: many, usually bacteria. 90% of bacteremic spread is from S. aureus.
- Routes of infection: hematogenous dissemination, direct implantation, contiguous site.
- Predisposing factors: immune suppression, vascular insufficiency
- Xrays will be normal initially, so do bone scan or MRI in acute setting for prompt diagnosis.
- In neonates and children, due to growth plates, major site of infection following hematogenous dissemination is the **metaphysis**.
- **Complications**: infection spreads to the cortex, lifts periosteum, and causes a sequestrum of devitalized cortical bone and reactive new bone (involucrum) to form. Sinus tract possible to skin. Further hematogenous dissemination possible. Pathological fractures. Chronic osteomyelitis.
