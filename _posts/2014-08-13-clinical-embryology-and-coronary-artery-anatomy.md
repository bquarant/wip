### Embryonic venous system
- Oxygenated blood from the placenta enters the sinus venosus through the umbilical vein.
- Anterior (draining the head) and common and posterior (draining the trunk) cardinal veins also drain deoxygenated blood into the sinus venosus.
- Vitelline veins return deoxygenated blood from the yolk sac, also draining into the sinus venosus. The sinus venosus develops into the coronary sinus.
- Vitelline, umbilical, and cardinal veins are initially paired; however, the left sided vitelline, umbilical, and posterior and common cardinal veins are resorbed during development. The anterior cardinal veins connect via an oblique anastomosis which allows left-to-right shunting and develops into the brachiocephalic vein.
- The right anterior cardinal vein and right common cardinal vein develop into the superior vena cava.

### Blood flow through the developing heart
- Mixed-oxygenated blood from the vitelline, umbilical, anterior cardinal, and posterior cardinal veins enters the sinus venosus through the common cardinal veins.
- Blood enters the atrium, then traverses the atrioventricular canal to enter the ventricle.
- On ventricular contraction, blood follows outflow path of the bulbis cordis and then truncus arteriosus into the pharyngeal arch arteries.

### Primitive Heart Tube @ 26 Days
- Because the bulbus cordis and ventricle grow faster than the other regions, the heart bends on itself, forming a U-shaped **bulboventricular loop**
- Coordination of the bulboventricular loop is mediated by TGF-Beta
- By this stage, the sinus venosus has developed lateral expansions called the left and right horns of the sinus venosus.

### Partitioning of the Heart
- Partitioning of the atrioventricular canal, atrium, and ventricle begins at the 4th week and is completed by the end of the 8th week.
- Endocardial cushions form the dorsal and ventral walls of the AV canal, and  approach each other and fuse, splitting the AV canal into a right and left AV canal. 
- The left and right AV canal partially separate the primordial atrium from the ventricle, and the endocardial cushions function as AV valves.
- Left and right AV canal at 42 days are separated by a **septum intermedium**, then ventricular septation begins by development of the muscular interventricular septum towards the truncus arteriosus.
- **Formation of the interatrial septum**: first, the septum primum grows towards the fusing endocardial cushions from the roof of the primordial atrium. This begins the process of splitting into left and right atria. The resulting RA->LA hole that arises is called the **foramen primum**, which allows shunting of oxygenated blood into the left atrium. This foramen becomes progressively smaller, then disappears when the septum primum fuses with the endocardial cushions. However, as the foramen primum becomes smaller, foramen secundum develop within the septum primum when select cells undergo apoptosis, allowing the shunting to continue. Lastly, the **septum secundum** develops immediately to the right of the location of the **septum primum**. The septum secundum is crescentic in shape and more muscular than than the septum primum, and overlaps the septum primum and most of the foramen secundum, leaving a smaller hole now called the **foramen ovale**, which still permits prenatal atrial blood shunting. 
- After birth, the foramen ovale functionally closes due to higher pressure in the left atrium, and the valve of the foramen ovale fuses with the septum secundum, forming the **fossa ovalis**, completing the interatrial septum.
- **Defects**: Patent foramen ovale, sinus venosus defect

### Formation of the Interventricular Septum
- See lecture on ventricular septal defects.
- Muscular ventricular septum develops from the apex of the heart towards the AV valves. 
- Ventricular septal defects are most common in the membranous area.
- The three structures that must fuse the complete ventricular septation: (1) endocardial cushions, (2) interventricular septum, (3) aorticopulmonary septum

<span><br></span>

### Formation of the Aorta and Pulmonary Artery
- Truncus arteriosus needs to be correctly partitioned into the aorta and pulmonary artery.
- The **aorticopulmonary septum** develops, splitting the truncus arteriosus into aorta and pulmonary trunk
- **Persistent truncus arteriosus**: defect where the interventricular or  aorticopulmonary septum fails to form, so blood from both ventricles empties into a common tube. This is potentially compatible with life, despite lower arterial blood oxygen concentration. 
- **Transposition of the great vessels**: failure of the twisting nature of the aorticopulmonary septum, causing the right heart to lead to the aorta and left heart to the pulmonary trunk. In-utero accommodations include maintaining a patent foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus; however, this defect is not compatible with life.
- **Tetralogy of Fallot**: Most common cyanotic baby congenital heart lesion. Root cause is a atrioventricular ring defect, causing off-center septation events. Net result is pulmonary trunk too small and eccentric, but four pathological components of the tetralogy: (1) pulmonary stenosis, (2) ventricular septal defect, (3) large, overriding aorta, and (4) enlarged right ventricle. To accommodate, ductus arteriosus must remain patent, and right ventricle hypertrophies due to need for increased work.

### Fetal circulation
- Blood is oxygenated in the placenta and returns to the fetal body through the umbilical vein.
- 50% of the umbilical venous blood goes through hepatic circulation, the remainder bypasses the liver via the **ductus venosus** to the inferior vena cava. Blood flow through the ductus venosus is regulated through a sphincter.
- Oxygenated blood comes to the heart through the inferior cava to the right atrium, where most of it follows a pressure differential through the foramen ovale into the left atrium. 
- Blood that does get into the right ventricle is pumped into the pulmonary trunk; however, there is high pulmonary resistance in utero, so blood that enters the pulmonary trunk follows a pressure gradient into the aorta via the **ductus arteriosus**.

### Coronary vascular anatomy
- First major branches off the aorta supply the heart; and are the right and left coronoary arteries.
- **Right coronary artery**: four branches. Sinuatrial (RA, SA node), right marginal (anterior right ventricle), posterior descending (posterior right ventricle), and artery to atrioventricular node.
- **Left coronary artery**: two branches. Left anterior descending (anterior left ventricle, 2/3 interventricular septum, apex), circumflex artery (posterior left atria, left ventricle).
- **Determining dominance**: From which vessel does the the posterior interventricular artery arise? (2/3 right, 1/3 left)
- **Cardiac veins**: most veins drain into the coronary sinus, which empties into the right atrium. The great cardiac vein drains most of the LAD.
- Sites of coronary artery occlusion, ordered: LAD, RCA, left circumflex, LCA, posterior interventricular, right circumflex.
