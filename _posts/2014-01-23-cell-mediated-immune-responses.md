### Objectives
- To understand the role of T-cells in disease
- To learn how T-cell responses develop
- To understand the molecular basis of T-cell priming / expansion and signaling
- To review short-term and long-term T-cell function

### T-cell Function - An Overview
- T cells eliminate intracellular pathogens by either directly killing the infected cell (CD8+ cells) or by activating phagocytic activity (CD4+ & CD8+ cells)
- T cells also can help defend against extracellular pathogens by inducing antibody responses from B cells (CD4+)
- Naive T-cells circulate through the blood to the peripheral lymphoid organs, where they meet foreign antigens as presented by the APCs

### T-cell:APC ligand-receptor pairs
- Key point: multiple interactions are required to achieve full T-cell activation
- While antigen recognition through the TCR:MHC interaction is essential, stabilizing and signaling molecules are both required in order to make things work. This is also termed the "immunological synapse"
- Clustering and increase in affinity of integrins drives strong T-cell:APC adhesion
- Signaling requires three co-receptors: **CD4 or CD8, CD3, and the Zeta chain**. These molecules have cytoplasmic ITAMs that promote signal transduction via phosphorylation.
- Co-stimulatory molecules are also required, and serve as an important checkpoint to guarantee T-cell activation only occurs in the setting of true infection. This is mediated by PAMP:PRR interaction on the APC surface leading to expression of B7 or CD40 on the APC surface. B7 interacts with CD28 on the T-cell, and CD40 interacts with CD40L on T-cell.
- There are also co-inhibitory molecules, e.g. **CTLA-4** which perform the opposite function of CD28 and shut down T-cell activation.
- Sufficient T-cell stimulation results in changes in transcription factor expression. We need to know about the **NFAT** pathway, which is activated by calcineurin and leads to IL-2 and IL-2 receptor synthesis. Cyclosporine inhibits calcineurin, thus decreases NFAT and leads to immunosuppression. We also need to know about the **mTOR** pathway, which increases protein synthesis necessary for clonal expansion. Rapamycin inhibits mTOR.
- *Autocrine signaling & IL-2*: Low affinity IL-2R is constitutively expressed, stimulation of T cell by the ABC with CD28:B7 interaction leads to increased NFAT transcription which stimulates IL-2 and IL-2R(alpha) production. IL-2R(alpha) now converts the IL-2R receptor to a high-affinity receptor, thus magnifying the strength of the IL-2 autocrine signal and driving T-cell clonal expansion. This mechanism insures that only T-cells that have been activated by the APC will be the ones that undergo clonal expansion.
- Overview: first, signaling leads to induction of numerous transcription factors (minutes-hours), then co-stimulatory molecule and cytokine/cytokine receptor upregulation occurs (hours-days), then T-cell proliferation and effector phenotype maturation.

### Biological actions of select T-cell cytokines
- **IL-2**: Made by CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Drives the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of effector and regulatory T-cells.
- **IL-4**: Made by CD4+ Th2 and mast cells. Drives B-cell isotype switching to IgE. Leads to alternative macrophage activation for enhanced fibrosis and tissue repair.
- **IL-5**: Made by CD4+ Th2 and mast cells. Drives eosinophil recruitment and survival.
- **IL-17**: Made by CD4+ Th17 cells. Stimulates acute inflammation
- **IFN-gamma**: Made by CD4+ Th1, CD8+, NK cells. Activates macrophages.
- **TGF-beta**: Made by CD4+, other cells. Inhibits T cell activation, differentiation to regulatory T cells.

### CD4+ T-cell Effector Functions
- CD4+ T-cells act as a "helper" to either innate immune cells or B cells.
- **CD40L** on T cells interacts with CD40 on macrophage or B cell (co-stimulatory interaction), and when this occurs in conjunction with a TCR:MHCII interaction, the T-cell releases cytokines that enhance phagocytosis or isotype-switching. Remember that the CD40 is only going to be expressed by the APC in response to PAMP:PRR activation.

### CD4+ T-cell Subsets
- **Th1**: Signature cytokine is IFN-gamma. Th1 cells activates macrophages and drives IgG production. Important for host defense against intracellular microbes, and plays a role in auto-immune diseases and tissue damage in chronic disease.
- **Th2**: Signature cytokines are IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Th2 cells activate mast cells and eosinophils and drive IgE production. Important for host defense against helminthic parasites and play a role in allergic diseases (see: Hypersensitivity)
- **Th17**: Signature cytokines are IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22. Th17 cells lead to neutrophilic, monocytic inflammation which is important for defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi. Roles in auto-immune and chronic inflammatory disease. Th17 deficiency leads to mucocutaneous candidiasis.

### Contraction of Effector Response and Development of Long-term Memory
- Effector response peaks at 5-7 days, followed by contraction from day 7-14.
- Elimination of pathogen results in lack of further stimulation and return to baseline.
- A small number (~5-10%) of T-cells survive long-term and become memory cells, which divide slowly but can be rapidly activated upon re-exposure.
- **Central memory**: located in lymphoid organs, undergo rapid clonal expansion upon re-exposure to antigens.
- **Effector memory**: located in periphery, provide rapid effector function at site of entry of microbe.
