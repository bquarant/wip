### Overview
-The chemical nature of hormones: hormones may either be very large glycoprotein, simple tripeptides, metabolites of single amino acids (with or without iodine), or metabolites of cholesterol.


### Hormone Synthesis
- Peptide Hormones: made through standard protein biosynthetic pathway. Example: insulin. Note preproinsulin --> proinsulin --> insulin + C-peptide. Measure C-peptide to see if there is endogenous insulin prodution.
- Thyroid Hormone biosynthesis: need DIT + TIT, will review. Hypothyroidism might be due to inefficient conversion of T4 to T3
- Steroid hormone biosynthesis: cholesterol is the precursor. Aromatase! C27 -> C21 -> C19 -> C18.
- Water soluble hormones are "transported into the free state" and have short half lives. They bind to speciifc receptors on the plasma membranes of target cells.
- Lipophilic hormones are transported mostly to *bound plasma proteins*, but it is the *free fraction* that is biologically active and controlled. 
- **Extraglandular activation of hormones**: classic example is conversion of thyroxine to TIT by the action of deiodinases. Example: testosterone can be converted to estrogen by aromatase
- Glucocorticoid: influenced by 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2, inactivates so that it can response to aldosterone, because both work on same target. Cortisol present in much higher concentrations, without it you'll retain water and become hypertensive.
- Can't make a diagnosis based just on low T4, need to get a TBG level otherwise you'll "be laughed out of the room." Total TBG up, T4 might be elevated too BUT given the ratio, normal....i
