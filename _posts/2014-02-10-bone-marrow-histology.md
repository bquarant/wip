### Hematopoietic Bone Marrow - Distribution
- Hematopoietic marrow is red; inactive marrow is yellow due to presence fat cells
- Red marrow occurs in the vertebrae, sternum, ribs, ilium, and flat bones of the skull.
- Red marrow volumetric content: 50% hematopoietic cells, 50% fat cells
- Amount of fat is used in microscopic histological assessment of hematopoietic activity; fewer fat cells indicates enhanced level of activity, acute leukemia bone marrow sample might be very dense and lacking fat cells!

### Hematopoietic Bone Marrow - Histological Organization
- Background network of stroma is made of **reticular cells (fibroblasts)** and fibers made up of Type III collagen which provide an adhesive network for developing cells. Developing blood cells typically randomly distributed amongst fat cells.
- There are also **sinuses**, which are thin-walled structures which blood cells have to pass through in order to exit the marrow.
- Earliest hematopoiesis happens in yolk sac "blood islands" between the 2nd and 10th week, mesodermal origin. These blood islands produce primitive RBCs with Gower hemoglobins I and II, as well as hemoglobin Portland. These cells disappear by the 4th month.
- **The hepatic period** - Blood cell precursors arise from the mesoderm layer in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region, then distribute to hematopoietic sites. Hemopoiesis begins in the **liver** in the 6th week in utero and diminishes by the 6th month, but still persists somewhat at birth. Erythrocytes with fetal hemoglobin, granulocytes, and myeloid megakaryocytes are produced during the hepatic period. Spleen displays parallel activity between the 3rd and 5th months, then also ceases.
- **The myeloid period** - bone marrow hemopoiesis starts at the 3rd month in utero, takes over as the major site at month 6, and persists for the remainder of life. Fetal hemoglobin is also made here, and the switch from *HbF* to *HbA* occurs at birth. Most frequent site for extramedullary hematopoiesis (a return to embryonic sites) is the spleen, second is the liver.

### Microscopic study of hemopoietic cells in bone marrow
- Standard method: aspirate marrow, dry film, and stain with **Wright's** stain
- All cell lines will be present and identifiable.
- Some basic rules for interpreting bone marrow smears: **(1)** The younger the cell, the bigger it will be; **(2)** the younger the cell, the more fragile the nucleus; and **(3)** For RBCs, the younger, more loaded with RNA and ribosomes (basophilic), but as they matures, loses ribosomes and is full of hemoglobin, therefore becomes eosinophilic.
- Bone marrow differential count: Quick rules: 1/2 will be some sort of PMN, 1/4 is a developing RBC (normoblast)
  * Myeloblasts - 1%
  * **Neutrophils and precursors - 55%**
  * Eosinophils and precursors - 3%
  * Basophils and precursors - 1%
  * **Normoblasts - 25%**
  * Lymphocytes - 15%
  * Plasma cells - 1%
  * Monocytes - 0.3%
- **Myeloid-erythroid ratio: (M:E)** - should be 2:1 or 3:1. Calculate ratio by quantifying number of developing and mature neutrophils to the number of normoblasts.

### Flowchart development of granulocytes
- Myeloblasts give rise to promyelocytes, give rise to myelocytes, give rise to metamyelocytes.

### Megakaryocyte
- Megakaryocyte and descendants undergo repeated endomitosis, characterized by the doubling of their DNA and division into new nuclei without division of cytoplasm followed by fusion of nuclei and then multiple repetitions yielding a giant, irregular nucleus.
- Azure granulation produced after huge nucleus is formed.
- Megakaryocyte shed several masses of cytoplasm, then each disintegrates into ~1000 platelets.
- This picture shows a megakaryoblast in the top left, a binucleated developing megakaryocyte in the top right, megakaryocytes in the middle; denuded nucleus bottom left.

### Contemporary Hematopoiesis Research
- Sub-lethal whole-body irradiation of mice kills their hemopoietic cells, they will die within a few weeks due to hemopoietic failure. Mice can be rescued by injecting bone marrow from an identical mouse. Mice treated this way demonstrate hemopoietic nodules in their spleens, each arising from one injected cell, the **Colony Forming Unit (CFU)**. 
- **Pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells exist**, they have **CD34** surface marker and give rise to all other blood cells. These cells are **self-renewing** by allowing one daughter cell to undergo differentiation while the other daughter cell remains a stem cell. On entering hemopoiesis, stem cell has two choices: be a **myeloid** or **lymphoid** origin.
- Marrow contains one stem cell per 1,000 hematopoietic cells, but these are not identifiable by routine staining.
- Blood contains one stem cell per 10,000 leukocytes, also not readily identifiable by routine staining.

### Regulation of Hemopoiesis
- Stem cells and other progenitors respond to factors from ambient cells (reticular, capillary/sinus endothelial cells, and fat cells) or monocytes/macrophages in the marrow
- The regulatory factors are called **hemopoietins**, such as colony-stimulator factor (CSF) or interleukins/cytokines, like IL-1. 
- **GM-CSF**: (granulocyte macrophage - colony stimulating factor). Trade name Prokine/Leukine (sargramostim). Stimulates stem cells and descendants to produce **granulocytes and monocytes**. Endogenous sources are macrophages, endothelium, fibroblasts, and T cells.
- **G-CSF**: (granulocyte - colony stimulating factor). Trade name Neupogen (filgrastim). Stimulates proliferation and differentiation of **neutrophils**, enhances mobilizations of stem cells from marrow to blood. Endogenous sources are macrophages, endothelium, and fibroblasts.
- **Erythropoietin** Trade names Epogen/Procrit. Regulates **erythrocyte** production. Usually manufactured in the kidney and distributed hematogenously. Greatest sensitivity by CFU-E, but BFU-E and pronormoblasts and basophilic normoblasts are also responsive. About 1 million people in the US are on this drug!
- **Sources of hemopoietic factors**: monocytes and macrophages are important source of myeloid-origin cells (CFU-GEMM), and also release **IL-1** and **TNF** which induces **CSFs** (see above!). T cells also release CSF when stimulated by foreign proteins or IL-1/TNF axis. Erythropoietin synthesized by cortical interstitial (i.e. connective tissue) cells of the kidney.
- **Clinical applications of hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs)**: Bone marrow transplantation: HSCs are mandatory for engraftment. Peripheral blood is now the most common source for HSCs for allogenic transplantation. Autologous stem cell collection is followed by cryopreservation. Umbilical cord blood stem cells have a higher content of stem cells with additional enhanced viability for transplantation.
