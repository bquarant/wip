### Hematopoietic Bone Marrow - Distribution
- Hematopoietic marrow is red, inactive marrow is yellow due to presence fat cells
- Red marrow occurs in the vertebrae, sternum, ribs, ilium, and flat bones of the cull.
- Red marrow volumetric content: 50% hematopoeitic cells, 50% fat cells
- Amount of at is used in microscopic histological assessment of hematopoeitic activity, fewer fat cells indicates enhanced level of activity.

### Histological Organization
- Background network of stroma is made of reticular cells (fibroblasts) and fibers made up of Type III collagen which provide an adhesive netowrk for developing cells.
- There are also 
- Earliest hematopoeisis happens in yolk sac "blood islands" between the 2-10th week, mesodermal origin. These blood islands produce primitive RBCs. Gower hemoglobins I and II, hemoglobin Portland. These cells disappear by the 4th month.
- **The hepatic period** - Blood cell precursors arise from intraembryonic mesoderm in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros, then go to hematopoietic sites. Hematopoeisis begins in the **liver** in the 6th week in utero and diminishes by month 6, but still persists somewhat at birth. Red cells, granulocytes, and myeloid megakaryocytes are produced. Fetal hemoglobin is being synthesized in the red blood cells. Spleen displays parallel activity between the 3rd and 5th months, then ceases.
- **The myeloid period** - bone marrow hematopoiesis starts at the 3rd month in utero, takes over as the major site at month 6, and persists for the remainder of life. Fetal hemoglobin is also made here, and the switch from *HbF* to **HbA** occurs at birth. Most frequent site for extramedullary hematopoiesis is the spleen, second is the liver.

### Microscopic study of hematopoietic cells in bone marrow
- Standard method: aspirate marrow, dry film, and stain with **Wright's** stain
- All cell lines will be present and identifiable.
- Some basic rules for interpreting bone marrow smears: **(1)** The younger, the bigger; **(2)** the younger, the more fragile the nucleus; and **(3)** For RBCs, the younger, more loaded with hemoglobin (basophilic!). As they matures, loses ribosomes and is full of hemoglobin, therefore becomes eosinophilic.
- Bone marrow differential count... **FOLLOW UP**
- **Myeloid-erythroid ratio: (M:E)** - should be 2:1 or 3:1. Quantify number of developing and mature neutrophils to the number of normoblasts. **follow up slide 25**

### Flowchart development of erythrocytes / normoblasts

### Flowchart development of granulocytes
- Myeloblasts give rise to promyelocytes, give rise to myelocytes, give rise to metamyelocytes.
- **Insert picture here**

### Megakaryocyte
- Megakaryocyte and descendants undergo repeated endomitosis, doubling of DNA and division into new nuclei without division of cytoplasm followed by fusion of nuclei and then multiple repetitions yielding a giant, irregular nucleus.
- Azure granulation produced after huge nucleus is formed.
- Megakaryocyte shed several masses of cytoplasm, then each disintegrates into ~1000 platelets.

### Contemporary Hematopoiesis Research
- Sub-lethal whole-body irradiation of mice kills their hemopoeitic cells, they will die within a few weeks due to hemopoietic failure. Mice can be rescued by injecting bone marrow from an identical mouse. Mice treated this way demonstrate hematopoeitic nodules in their spleens, each arising from one injected cell, the **Colony Forming Unit**. 
- Pluripotent hematopoeitic stem cells exist, they have **CD34** surface marker and give rise to all other blood cells. These cells are **self-renewing** by allowing one daughter cell to undergo differentiation while the other daughter cell remains a stem cell. On entering hematopoeisis, stem cell has two choices: be a **myeloid** or **lymphoid** origin.
- Marrow contains one stem cell per 1,000 hematopoietic cells, but these are not identifiable by routine staining.
- Blood contains one stem cell per 10,000 leukocytes, also not readily identifiable by routine staining.

### Regulation of Hematopoeisis
- Stem cels and other progenitors respond to factors from ambient cells (reticular, capillary/sinus endothelial cells, and fat cells) or monocytes/macrophages in the marrow
- The regulatory factors are called **hemopoietins**, such as colony-stimulator factor (CSF) or interleukins, like IL-1. 
- **GM-CSF**: (granulocyte macrophage - colony stimulating factor). Prokine/Leukine (sargramostim). Stimulates stem cells and descendants to produce granulocytes and monocytes. Endogenous sources are macrophages, endothelium, fibroblasts, and T cells.
- **G-CSF** (granulocyte - colony stimulating factor). Neupogen (filgrastim). Stimulates proliferation and differentiation of neutrophils, enhances mobilizations of stem cells from marrow to blood. Endogenous sources are macrophages, endothelium, and fibroblasts.
- **Erythropoeitin** Epogen/Procrit. Regulates red cell production. Usually manufactured in the kidney and distributed hematogenously. Greatest sensitivity by CFU-E, but BFU-E and pro- and basophilic normoblasts are also responsive. 1 million people in the US are on this drug!
- **Follow-up: slide 38-39**
- **Clinical applications of stem cells**: Bone marrow transplantation: HSCs are mandatory for engraftment. Peripheral blood is now the most common source for HSCs for allogenic transplantation. Autologous stem cell collection is followed by cryopreservation. Umbilical cord blood stem cells have a higher content of stem cells with additional enhanced viability for transplantation.
