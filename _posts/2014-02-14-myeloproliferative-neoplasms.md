### Learning Objectives

### Myeloproliferative neoplasms
- Myeloproliferative neoplasms share common stem cell-derived clonal heritage, their phenotypic expression depends on which genes have been affected and has led to re-classification based on molecular differences.

<span><br></span>

###How are MPN similar:?
- Splenomegaly common in all, often due to extra-medullary hematopoiesis.
- Increased risk of thrombosis or bleeding due to abnormal platelets
- Constitutional symptoms
- Slow progression of disease
- Similar peripheral blood findings: anemia with variable RBC change, leukocytosis with immature cells, eosinophils or basophils
- Similar bone marrow findings: panmyelosis, increased cellularity to fat ratio, fibrosis
- **Big Problem:** Can be accelerated to a blast crisis.

### Polycythemia Vera / Erythrocytosis
- **Presentation**: symptoms of hyperviscosity: headaches, blurry vision, thromboembolic disease; symptoms of hypermetabolism: gout, night sweats, pruritis; often though they are asymptomatic
- Increased red cell mass caused by clonal proliferation of marrow erythroid stem cell. With time, megakaryocyte growth factors causes fibrotic changes in the bone marrow.
- **Relative erythrocytosis**: normal red cell mass but decreased plasma volume which results in a increased hematocrit.
- **True erythrocytosis**: primary - polycythemia vera. secondary - need to determine if appropriate or inappropriate. Appropriate secondary polycythemia due to compensation in the setting of lung disease, smoking, high altitudes. Inappropriate secondary polycythemia due to renal pathology leading to increased erythropoietin. 
- **Labs**: WBC - PCV typically have increase in WBC and platelets. LDH or uric acid - typically slightly elevated, evidence of hypermetabolism. Ferritin - should be low, chronic overproduction of red cells leads to iron depletion. Erythropoietin - should be low.
- **Molecular diagnosis**: PCR for **JAK2**, V617F mutation (valine to phenylalanine) in a regulatory domain, gain of function mutation causing "erythroblasts to go on autopilot" and not respond to erythropoietin. 95% have this problem.
- **Treatment**: goal is to maintain normal hematocrit and platelet count in order to reduce the risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events. Choices: routine phlebotomy, cytoxic therapy, anti-Jak2 agents
- **Prognosis**: median survival 10-16 years, major problem is thrombosis and hemorrhage. 30% develop myelofibrosis causing "burn out". 5% develop AML, use of chemotherapy increases this risk.

### Essential thrombocythemia
- Sustained increase in platelet count, greater than 450,000. Other causes of elevated platelet count includes hemorrhage, iron deficiency, inflammation, infection, disseminated malignancy, a/hyposplenism or familial syndromes. 
- **Findings**: many are asymptomatic, splenomegaly 50%, thrombosis or hemorrhage, erythromelalgia (painful digits).
- **Labs**: platelet count greater than 450,000, often over 1,000,000. Abnormal, large platelets on peripheral smear. Bone marrow shows increased number of large mature megakaryocytes. Platelet function tests are abnormal, including aggregation abnormalities.
- Diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out PV, PMF, CML, or MDS
- **Molecular diagnosis**: 50% have a Jak2 mutation, 5% have MPL mutation on thrombopoietin.
- **Treatment**: risk stratify based on age, platelet count, previous thrombosis or hemorrhage, and Jak2 status. Modify risk factors such as smoking and hypertension. Treat with low-dose aspirin if low-risk, high-risk gets chemotherapy agents (hydroxyurea)

### Primarily Myelofibrosis
- Progressive, generalized fibrosis of bone marrow caused by abnormal megakaryocytes and platelet derived growth factors stimulating the fibroblasts. Reaction leads to extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver and spleen.
- **Presentation**: insidious onset of massive hepatosplenomegaly, with secondary portal hypertension with progressive cytopenias. Die from thrombotic or hemorrhagic events
- **Diagnosis**: presence of megakaryocyte proliferation accompanied with collagen or reticulin fibrosis. Does not meet criteria for PV, CML, MDS, ET. 
- **Labs**: leukoerythroblastic blood smear with tear-drop, nucleated RBCs and immature WBCs. Bone marrow is often a dry tab. Biopsy is fibrotic, increased megakaryocytes. Jak2 positive in 50%.
- **Prognosis**: much worse than PV, ET, or CML. Splenomegaly leads to portal hypertension, but removing it is dangerous and perhaps not beneficial?
- **Treatment**: supportive transfusions as necessary, sometimes hydroxyurea, sometimes splenectomy. Survival is less than 5 years for intermediate to high IPSS score disease. Newly approved drug ruxolitinib helps improve spleen volume in patients with intermediate to high risk disease.

### Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)
- First human malignancy in which a non-random, recurring cytogenetic abnormality has been identified and targeted.
- **Labs**:  Slightly anemic with gradual rise in WBC with entire spectrum present, including eosinophils and basophils. Marrow: hypercellular with marked increase in myeloid:erythroid ratio, increased megakaryocytes, some fibrosis. Cytogenetics: bcr/abl translocation is diagnostic of CML, can be done either on the marrow or peripheral blood.
- **Accelerated phase**: worsening malaise, fatigue, weight loss, bone pain, blood counts worsening, progressive splenomegaly, increase in promyelocytes and blasts in the peripheral smear.
- **Treatment**: Hydroxyurea and bone marrow transplant, historically. Now, use imatinib (Gleevec), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Some adverse effects, but the big problem is clonal resistance There's second generation TKIs around, but you have to pay close attention for drug-drug interactions and QT prolongation.



### Pearls
- Any time you have an increased platelet count, get a ferritin level to evaluate for iron deficiency.
