- **17-hydroxylase deficiency**: rare cause of CAH, mineralocorticoid excess (hypertension and hypokalemia) with glucocorticoid and adrenal androgen deficiency. 46XY karyotype presents with pseudohermaphrodism and ambiguous genitalia, 46XX karyotype presents with absence of secondary sexual development
- **Helicotrema**: wide and flexible distal apex of the cochlea, responsible for registration of low frequency vibrations on the tonotopic map.
- **Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum**: skin manifestation of Fabry disease (alpha-galactosidase A deficiency), causes a build up of ceramide trihexoside; progresses to acroparesthesia and progressive renal insufficiency then renal failure.
- **Leukocytoclastic angiitis**: small vessel vasculitis in the skin and GI tract seen in Henoch-Schonlein purpura; biopsy shows IgA and C3 deposition. Associated with arthralgias and IgA nephropathy or synpharyngitic nephritis
- Q: How are Hirschprung disease and Tetrology of Fallot similar? A: both are due to failure of migration of neural crest cells!
- **Councilman bodies**: eosinophilic inclusions found in apoptotic hepatocytes during acute viral hepatitis (mostly likely C in IVDU), also a lymphocytic infiltrate may be present
- **Negative predictive value**: the probability that a patient really doesn't have a disease if they test negative for it. On a 2x2 table, **NPV = d / (c+d)**
- Reasons for **exacerbations in myasthenia gravis**: (1) **myasthenic crisis**: suboptimal acetycholinesterase inhibitor dosing leads to deficiency of synaptic acteylcholine; edrophonium test positive, increase AChEi. (2) **cholinergic crisis**: AChEi overdose causes excessive stimulation, causing muscles to fail to respond; edrophonium test negative. 
- **Hering-Breuer reflex**: the duration of inspiration depends on the degree of lung distension; mediated by myelinated and unmyelinated pulmonary C fibers and stretch receptors, protect lung from hyperinflation

**MEMORIZE LIST**
- MEN 1: tumors of the parathyroid, pancreas, and pituitary
- MEN 2A: medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, parathyroid tumor
- MEN 2B: medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, mucosal neuromas
- MEN 2: d/t mutation of RET proto-oncogene, affects neural crest cells (i.e. chromaffin and C-cells) migrating to various areas (like the four pharyngeal pouches and the adrenal medulla).

- Balint's syndrome: simultagnosia, oculomotor apraxia, optic ataxia.
