## Thoughts

<br>

## Done

* updated hribuffalo post from UB reporter

<br>

## Rosalind.info

* Completed ini4.py, simple loops and array stuff
* Complete ini5.py, loop around input block of text, output a new line with only the even lines

<br>

## Rails
* Learning this again, from scratch...
* While I do still remember some of the tedious stuff, it's been over a year since I've done anything in Rails so I wanted to start again from the beginning, take it slow and just have fun with it. Thusly: [Rails for Zombies](http://railsforzombies.org/levels/1)

<br>

```ruby
##new hash inside b variable
b = { id: 3,
      status: "text",
      user: "Name"}

b[:user] + " said " + b[:status]

p = Post.find(3)
```
<br>
```ruby
rails generate controller welcome
```
<br>
* create index.html.erb --> make coming soon landing page
* modify config/routes.rb --> set default route to welcome landing page
