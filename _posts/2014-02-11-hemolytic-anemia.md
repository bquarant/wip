### Normal erythrocyte processing
- Normal life span of the healthy erythrocyte is approximately 120 days, premature destruction resulting in shorter life span is called **hemolysis**.
- Bone marrow capable of increasing production approximately 5-6 fold; if destruction outpaces production, **anemia** will develop.
- Hemolysis can be categorized in several different ways: intrinsic vs. extrinsic, intravascular vs. extravascular, acute vs. chronic, immune vs. non-immune. 
- RBC loses membrane over time due to clearance by phagocytic cells of the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and reticuloendothelial system. Hemoglobin is broken down by the heme oxygenase (Hox) system, but the iron is conserved and packaged away as ferritin. Heme breakdown products: heme, (hox/cytp450r), biliverdin (biliverdin reductase), bilirubin, conjugated in liver to bilirubin glucoronide, excreted as bile.
- The spleen is the major site of RBC destruction, and because RBCs are exposed to a hypoxic environments, metabolically challenged cells will be exposed and removed. Cells with inclusions (see: bite cells in G6PD, malaria) are removed because they are not pliable enough. Reticuloendothelial cells display Fc receptors and C3b, so if there's Ig bound to the RBC membrane, this will trigger removal (see: autoimmune hemolytic anemia, AIHA). Thus, chronic hemolysis leads to splenomegaly.
- **What happens with RBCs are lysed**: free hemoglobin in the blood dimerizes and gets picked up by its carrier protein, **haptoglobin**, and is taken to the macrophage or liver for further processing. In the macrophage, heme groups broken down to unconjugated bilirubin and re-released into circulation; in hepatocyte heme group breakdown also occurs but bilirubin gets conjugated and released into the biliary system. If there are **excess hemoglobin dimers**, these get filtered by the kidney, leading to **hemoglobinuria**
- **Measurement and meaning of bilirubin**: Measure and compare unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin. Increased bilirubin production due to hemolysis will lead to much more unconjugated bilirubin relative to conjugated. Biliary obstruction (regardless of hepatic or extra-hepatic) will lead to **more equivalent** concentrations of unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin.

### Extrinsic hemolytic disorders
- **Hypersplenism**: chronic sequestration of RBCs
- **Auto-immune**: cold antibody (IgM), warm antibody (IgG), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
- **Direct infection of erythrocyte**: babesia, bartonella, malaria
- **Toxin-mediated infectious disease**: clostridia, meningococcus
- **Mechanical trauma**: march hemoglobinuria, TTP, HUS, valvular destruction, malignant hypertension, aortic stenosis
- **Environmental toxin**: lead, copper, oxidizers, snake or insect venom

<span><br></span>

### Intrinsic hemolytic disorders
- **Congenital membrane abnormalities**: hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis
- **Metabolic disorders**: pyruvate kinase deficiency, G6PD deficiency, porphyrias
- **Hemoglobin synthesis disorders**: sickle cell disease, thalassemia, sickle/thal, hemoglobin C, hemoglobin E, hemoglobin SC.

### Extravascular vs. Intravascular hemolysis
- **Extravascular**: most common; damaged or abnormal red cells are cleared from circulation by reticular endothelial system. This is where RBCs coated with IgG are cleared.
- **Intravascular**: occurs when erythrocyte membrane has been severely damage by shear stress, toxins, direct trauma, or fibrin deposition in vessels. Haptoglobin will bind free hemoglobin and transport it to the reticular endothelial system. Lots of hemolysis will cause hemoglobin to be reabsorbed in the renal tubular cells, some of which will turn into hemosiderin; some of this will either be recycled or excreted.

### How to diagnose hemolysis?
- **Icterus**: first noticeable in the sclera; will progress to dermatological findings (jaundice) when bilirubin >3. Pancreatic cancer bilirubin can become very elevated (~15). 
- **Dark or red urine**: should raise red flags for hemoglobinuria, intravascular hemolysis.
- **Splenomegaly**: should raise red flags for extravascular hemolysis and sequestration.
- **Lack of response to transfusion**: 1U pRBCs = 1 point elevation in hemoglobin. Transfuse 3U but no delta hemoglobin =  r/o hemolysis
- **Rising MCV**: first response will be to spill immature cells, net effect will cause MCV and RDW to increase.
- **Peripheral smear clues**: schistocytes, other changes in RBCs to suggest hemolysis?
- **Labs**: serum bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Normal = 225, rises, Aggressive hemolysis can get >800 .
- **Special labs**: low haptoglobin, urinary hemosiderin, Coombs test, hemoglobin electrophoresis (r/o thalassemia)
- **Making the diagnosis**: elevated bilirubin, elevated LDF, low haptoglobin, elevated reticulocyte count. **Coombs test / DAT** - RBCs vs. anti-Human IgG positive test causes the cells to agglutinate, order if you think AIHA.

### Morphologic changes in the peripheral smear
- **Spherocytosis**: can be due to transfused blood (preservation methods). IgG "warm" hemolytic anemia - spleen Fc receptor, part of the membrane is consumed, thus causing spherocytosis.
- **Schistocytes**: shredded red cells, intravascular hemolysis from shear stress "over something".
- **Target cells**: hemoglobinopathies! Next move should be to hemoglobin electrophoresis to rule out thalassemic syndromes.
- **Agglutinated cells**
- **Inclusions**
- **Bite cells**: G6PD deficiency, more common in AA, poor control of oxidative stress. Bites due to phagocytic removal of inclusion bodies.

### Erythrocyte membrane
- Complex array of lipid bilayer with uncharged phospholipids on the outside, charged phospholipids on the inside. Two planes of interaction.
- Cytoskeleton primarily made of spectrin, responsible for biconcavity of healthy RBCs. Has alpha and beta chain. Anchored to bilayer through other proteins named ankyrin and band4.1
- Glycophorin C (blood-type determining antigen), impart a negative charge to the cell.
- **Hereditary elliptocytosis**: number of genetic defects lead to destabilization of the cytoskeleton in the horizontal plane (spectrin:spectrin/band4.1 interaction). Shear stress in the capillary system and the inability of the erythrocyte to deform appropriately and causes decreased survival of the erythrocyte. Heterozygous disease, but patients are typically anemic.
- **Hereditary spherocytosis**: problem of linking the cytoskeleton to the bilayer - "vertical plane." Most common defect is in ankyrin which helps binds the cytoskeleton to the membrane. Spherocytosis leads to a cycle of splenic trapping, erythrostasis, and hemolysis.. Treat with splenectomy, that will improve the anemia due to removing the main source of their destruction.

### Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)
- Develops when patient produces antibodies against their own red cel antigens, usually against high incidence antigens. Can be either IgG (leading to phagocytosis, "warm"), IgM (leading to complement activation and intravascular hemolysis). Can be primary (idiopathic), secondary.
- **Secondary AIHA**. Settings: autoimmune disease (SLE), lymphoproliferative disease (lymphoma), drugs (chemotherapy?), infection (HIV, HCV).
- **Treatment**: treat the underlying disorder if possible (Lupus? Steroids. HIV? Antiretrovirals.), otherwise you need to suppress the immune system (corticosteroids, rituximab, splenectomy, IVIG)

### Hemolytic Anemia - The Workup
- Thorough family history
- Medication use history
- Transfusion history (may develop Ab due to exposure to foreign RBC )
- Patient appear clinically ill? (r/o bacterial process, DIC)
- Get a CBC!
- Get a reticulocyte count and a peripheral smear.
- Everyone should get bilirubin, LDH, urinalysis, Coombs.
