### Objectives
- **Follow up!**

<span><br></span>


### How to diagnose hemolysis?
- **Icterus** dermatological findings (jaundice) when bilirubin >3, Pancreatic ca = 15, but subtle elevations first and best seen in the sclera
- **Dark or red urine**
- **Splenomegaly**
- **Lack of response to transfusion**: 1U pRBCs = 1 point elevation in hemoglobin. Transfuse 3U but no delta hemoglobin =  r/o hemolysis
- **Rising MCV**
- **Peripheral smear clues**: schistocytes, other changes in RBCs to suggest hemolysis?
- **Labs**: serum bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Normal = 225, rises, Aggressive hemolysis can get >800 .
- **Special labs**: low haptoglobin, urinary hemosiderin, Coombs test, hemoglobin electrophoresis (r/o thalassemia)
- **Making the diagnosis**: elevated bilirubin, elevated LDF, low haptoglobin, elevated reticulocyte count. **Coombs test / DAT** - RBCs vs. anti-Human IgG positive test causes the cells to aggluinate, order if you think AIHA.

### Morphologic changes in the peripheral smear
- **Spherocytosis**: can be due to transfused blood (preservation methods). IgG "warm" hemolytic anemia - spleen Fc receptor, part of the membrane is consumed, thus causing spherocytosis.
- **Schistocytes**: shredded red cells, intravascular hemolysis from shear stress "over something".
- **Target cells**: hemoglobinopathies! Next move is to do hemoglobin electrophoresis to rule out thalassemic syndromes.
- **Aggluinated cells**
- **Inclusions**
- **Bite cells**: G6PD deficiency, more common in AA, poor control of oxidative stress. Bites due to phagocytic removal of inclusion bodies.

### Erythrocyte membrane
- Complex array of lipid bilayer with uncharged phospholipids on the outside, charged phospholipids on the inside. Two planes of interaction.
- Cytoskeleton primarily made of spectrin, responsible for biconcavity of healthy RBCs. Has alpha and beta chain. Anchored to bilayer through other proteins named ankyrin and band4.1
- Glycophorin C (blood-type determining antigen), impart a negative charge to the cell.
- **Hereditary elliptocytosis**: number of genetic defects lead to destabilization of the cytoskeleton in the horizontal plane (spectrin:spectrin/band4.1 interaction). Shear stress in the capillary system and the inability of the erythrocyte to deform appropriately and causes decreased survival of the erythrocyte. Heterozygous disease, but patients are typically anemic.
- **Hereditary spherocytosis**: problem of linking the cytoskeleton to the bilayer - "vertical plane." Most common defect is in ankyrin which helps binds the cytoskeleton to the membrane. Spherocytosis leads to a cycle of splenic trapping, erythrostasis, and hemolysis.. Treat with splenectomy, that will improve the anemia due to removing the main source of their destruction.

### Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
- Develops when patient produces antibodies against their own red cel antigens, usually against high incidence antigens. Can be either IgG (phagocytosis, "warm"), IgM (complement activation and intravascular hemolysis). Can be primary (idiopathic), secondary.
- **Secondary AIHA**. Settings: autoimmune disease (SLE), lymphoproliferative disease (lymphoma), drugs (chemotherapy?), infection (HIV, HCV).
- **Treatment**: treat the underlying disorder if possible (Lupus? Steroids. HIV? Antiretrovirals.), otherwise you need to suppress the immune system (corticosteroids, rituximab, splenectomy, IVIG)

### Hemolytic Anemia - The Workup
- Thorough family history
- Medication use history
- Transfusion history (may develop Ab due to exposure to foreign RBC )
- Patient appear clinically ill? (r/o bacterial process, DIC)
- Get a CBC!
- Get a reticulocyte count and a peripheral smear.
- Everyone should get bilirubin, LDH, urinalysis, Coombs.
