### Pediatric Fractures
- Paradox: high remodeling potential, but growth plate injury with permanent growth arrest is possible
- Salter-Harris classifications of growth plate injury has been developed.
- Salter I: fracture goes just across growth plate. Typically do not cause growth problems, because it goes across the zone of provisional calcification and not through resting reserve zone. "Typically heal with no problem or long-term sequelae"
- Salter II: goes across growth plate and then out through the metaphysis, again not going through the resting reserve zone and typically heals well without consequences.
- Salter III: goes through epiphysis, and then into the growth plate. Crosses resting reserve zone, can cause permanent growth problems.
- Salter IV: goes across both epiphysis and metaphysis, can also result in permanent growth problem. 
- Salter V: Crush injury, just across the growth plate, usually noted retrospectively!?

### Scoliosis
- Definition: lateral curvature of the spine more than 10 degrees. 
- Test: Adams Forward Bend Test - evaluate for equal shoulders
- Classification: location (C/T/L/S), etiology, age (infantile, juvenile, adolescent).
- Etiology: idiopathic, congenital, neuromuscular, connective tissue related. Nothing to do with posture!
- Things that might look like scoliosis but is not: basic postural problems, leg length discrepancy, or Sprengel's deformity (un-descended scapula)
- Indications for MRI: pain, neurological symptoms, atypical curve
- Treat with observation if curve less than 25 degrees, brace if curve greater than 30 and still growing, surgery if curve is greater than 50.

### Childhood Hip Conditions
- **Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH)**: a spectrum of hip instability problems. Leads to early arthritis in teens or 20s. Usually have normal gait and can be clinically silent..
- DDH Risk Factors: **breech position**, female sex, first born child, family history of ligamentous laxity, ethnicity
- Diagnosis: infants - abnormal nursery exam + breech birth is concerning. Toddlers might show short leg, limp, toe walking. If bilateral, they might waddle. Typically not much in the ways of pain or irritability.
- Treatment of DDH ideally involves early diagnosis and bracing with a **Pavlic harness**. 
- Ortolani maneuver: reduces a dislocated hip, abduct and lift the greater trochanter; Barlow maneuver: dislocates a reduced hip, adduct the leg to the midline and push gently down and lateral.
- Imaging: under 4 months, use ultrasound due to incomplete ossification; older, xray is appropriate.
- **Slipped capital femoral epiphysis**: concern for presentations with hip and leg pain in obese children.
